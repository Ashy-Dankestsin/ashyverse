## Hi! Thanks for checking this out!
This wiki serves as a comprehensive database for the entirety of the Ashyverse. From worldbuilding to characters, it aims to provide details that may be missed in casual discussion, and to serve as a jumping-off point for those interested in the lore. The ultimate goal is to turn this into a comic of sorts online, perhaps even a game. It's an ambitious project, but one I hope will come to fruition. Hope you enjoy it!
