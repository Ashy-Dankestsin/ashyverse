#### Personality and History
Latest in a long line of royal guards who have served the Sky Mother, Lin Fuyun was chosen to be the attendant to the latest in the Royal Blood, the princess Yong Wen. Raised under a rigid set of values, Fuyun never allowed much leeway in her life to make her own choices, having lived only to serve the Princess of Sky Mother's Domain and her own family's name. Perhaps in spite of this, however, she remained relatively unknown in the background of the nation, and lived a quiet life as the Princess' closest attendant. That is, until the civil war uprooted the foundations of her homeland, and she was called to action. What she would ultimately choose, however, was far from expectations.

Stern and almost constantly scowling, Fuyun speaks in harsh tones without ever a hint of irony to them. Her words are concise but cutting, and she rarely ever leaves an opinion unspoken regardless of the impact it might have. She is blunt in her statements, yet Fuyun herself doesn't seem to realize how harsh she can be. As far as she's concerned, it's simply how people speak to one another. This nature has been the cause of many an argument with strangers, but Fuyun doesn't seem to mind all that much.

Honest to a fault, it is easy to infer that Fuyun simply doesn't seem to get sarcasm. In a sense, she is incredibly pure, and has claimed to have never spoken a lie in her life. Her sense of humour, as well, is somewhat lacking, and it's common to see her tilt her head and laugh along for the sake of it. Though it's easy to say she's antisocial for it, the true reason is far simpler; raised under the strict values of being a royal guard, humour was far from anything she's ever experienced properly.

Despite all her platitudes, she is also somewhat of a scrappy individual. Though it has died down somewhat in her adulthood, Fuyun was known for being a rambunctious child, often picking fights with anyone who look at her wrong. Even as an adult, she is prone to fights, and still tries to maintain a distance with those close to her.

She holds both achievements and failures close to her heart, and never lets them go, for better or for worse. Fuyun sticks close to these ideals, ones that she has built up throughout her life as the only genuine part of herself she was allowed to cultivate. She places great emphasis on trust, and will rarely ever let down her guard for those unfamiliar to her. For the few who have broken through, however, there is rarely another person more trustworthy.

#### Skills
**Martial Arts**
Trained since youth in all manner of martial arts, Fuyun is a master of close quarter combat. A master of none, she calls upon combinations of the country's hundreds of styles through a storm of fists and kicks. Her fighting style, even within Sky Mother's Domain, is unorthodox and unpredictable, perhaps a remnant of her penchant for street brawls. Nevertheless, Fuyun is perhaps the nation's finest brawler, and you can count on her to pull no punches.

**Language of Magic: Wind**
Fuyun's specialty and favored form of magic, capable of manifesting whipping and whirling wind currents that she can use for both offense and defense. Applying these magics to her martial arts, Fuyun can Augment her strikes with accompanying whirlwind force, knocking enemies much further back than a regular punch. Other applications include vaccuum winds to drag foes towards her, or using wind to increase speed and overall mobility.
Her personal specialty is Augmentation, and she has no particular talent in any other magic form.

**Enhanced Physical Stats**
To ensure her body wouldn't give way under the stress of her training, Fuyun has underwent heavy endurance and physical strength training her whole life. This has given her decent musculature and stamina. Her endurance, however, is her greatest asset, and combined with her physical abilities, Fuyun can win almost any battle of attrition she comes across through sheer force.
