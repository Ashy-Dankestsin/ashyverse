#### Personality and History
Born to a small but loving family in the outskirts of the Qiu Mountains, Lin Fuyun was descended of golden blood, stemming from an ancient blood tie to a Golden Qilin warrior of the ancient past. Nevertheless, she lived a modest and happy life. 8 years ago, she was chosen to be the replacement for the deceased Eternity Guard Lee, and taken from her small village to live in the Royal Capital, under the Mandate of the First Will. For the next few years of her life, she would live anything but her own, and was forced to comply with the rigidity of the Highlands. Despite her best efforts to train, as well as a budding relationship with the princess whom she was charged to protect, Fuyun would eventually run from her post, becoming a fugitive to the entire nation.

Stern and almost constantly scowling, Fuyun speaks in harsh tones without ever a hint of irony to them. Her words are concise but cutting, and she rarely ever leaves an opinion unspoken regardless of the impact it might have. She is blunt in her statements, yet Fuyun herself doesn't seem to realize how harsh she can be. As far as she's concerned, it's simply how people speak to one another. This nature has been the cause of many an argument with strangers, but Fuyun doesn't seem to mind all that much.

Honest to a fault, it is easy to infer that Fuyun simply doesn't seem to get sarcasm. In a sense, she is incredibly pure, and has claimed to have never spoken a lie in her life. Her sense of humour, as well, is somewhat lacking, and it's common to see her tilt her head and laugh along for the sake of it. Though she may appear antisocial, it is primarily due to her years of living under the harsh rule of the First Will that has somewhat diminished her ability to understand and read social cues that aren't telegraphed.

Despite all her platitudes, she is also somewhat of a scrappy individual. Though it has died down somewhat in her adulthood, Fuyun was known for being a rambunctious child, often picking fights with anyone who look at her wrong. Even as an adult, she is prone to fights, and still tries to maintain a distance with those close to her.

Due to the influence of being forced into a role that wasn't her own, Fuyun has grown deeply insecure about herself as a person. Often unable to differentiate from herself and the man whose name and title she took, she has difficulty trusting her own thoughts as being hers, and subconsciously still refers to herself as Lee. This lack of self also extends to an inability to trust those around her; 8 years of her life were spent in a seemingly never-ending play, and as such Fuyun struggles to discern the honesty of those around her from fake platitudes parroted on-stage. She's figuring it out.

#### Skills
**Boundary of the Body Martial Technique - Intermediate**
Trained since youth in all manner of Sky Mother's Domain's unique form of martial arts, Fuyun possesses strong understanding and application of the mixed unarmed form art known as the Boundary of the Body. For most trainees, they would specialize in one specific form; Fuyun, however, due to her father's strict lessons, has undergone training for all 4 primary forms of this martial technique, and has subsequently become an intermediate user of all 4. From open palm strikes, to powerful kicks, to earth-splintering punches, she is a jack of all trades, capable of effortlessly switching between forms to a staggering degree. This gives her a uniquely disorienting combat style, likened less to a trained martial artist and more to a formless street brawler.

**Language of Magic: Wind**
Fuyun's specialty and favored form of magic, capable of manifesting whipping and whirling wind currents that she can use for both offense and defense. Applying these magics to her martial arts, Fuyun can Augment her strikes with accompanying whirlwind force, knocking enemies much further back than a regular punch. Other applications include vacuum winds to drag foes towards her, or using wind to increase speed and overall mobility.
Her personal specialty is Augmentation, and she has no particular talent in any other magic form.

**Enhanced Physical Stats**
To ensure her body wouldn't give way under the stress of her training, Fuyun has underwent heavy endurance and physical strength training her whole life. This has given her decent musculature and stamina. Her endurance, however, is her greatest asset, and combined with her physical abilities, Fuyun can win almost any battle of attrition she comes across through sheer force.
