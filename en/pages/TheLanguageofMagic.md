# The Language of Magic

>*"Our first step to understanding the true nature of the Language of Magic is to decode what was left behind by its true speakers; That is, humanity. What was their everyday life is seen as a miracle to the rest of the world, and perhaps the only way we can come to understand it, is by looking into our own selves."* - Silver Sage Mahal, *The Language of Magic Volume 1*

In the distant past, the words spoken by Humanity carried a mysticism and power unlike any other language in all of Orbis. The weight of its words, the strength of its text, all was of limited understanding in the ancient world. However, through the arduous research of many scholars throughout the centuries, the foundation of the language has become normality across the world.

Magic, as it is known, is a common practice around the world. From farmers and housewives boiling water with Invoked flames, to knights and sorcerers who command magic elements like an extension of their blades. The use of the Language has permeated much of modern society, to the point where its origins have been near-forgotten. "It has always been with us", most would say. It is from the roots of the Language of Magic that we are capable of creating such miracles, however. Indeed, the uniqueness of the Language is in its ability to call forth corresponding elements of the natural world, or even beyond, by speaking their True Names. 

Linguistically, the Language of Magic is best described as a jumble of indiscernable symbols and codes. Analysis reveals variations of upwards of 40 individual letters, with different permutations and combinations depending on the desired use. This makes the decoding process of any ancient scripts a difficult and painful task, only undergone by the most dedicated scholars. Sentence structure is unlike any found, either, with sentences going on for almost entire pages to accomodate its strange punctuation system. All of this combines to paint a picture of this mysterious language; archaic and unique, it is a voice heard to none other than the speakers of Humanity, and whether they created it or not still remains a great mystery, lost to the silver sands of their ruined homeland.

## True Names

>*"Hard as it may be to imagine, every living being when birthed seems to be given a name. Not the names by which our mothers and fathers grant upon us, but from a greater power entirely. Such impossibilities are the foundation of the Language of Magic. Thus, let us dub them... True Names."* - Silver Sage Mahal, *The Language of Magic Volume 1* 

From the moment of one's birth, an invisible, unknowable title is cast upon them. Be they mortal or immortal, material and immaterial, it matters not. A rock may have a True Name in much the same way a Volken would. To truly grasp the Language of Magic, one must grasp True Names, first. Based on contemporary research and accepted theorems, every True Name, unique to its owner, is composed of massive strings of text, very often ever going below 10 words. From there, they can be further classified into two distinct forms of True Names: Foundational and Compositional.

### Foundational

True Names belonging to naturally-occurring elements are classified as Foundational True Names. The building blocks of all things in nature, and all things fundamental to the world. Water, fire, earth, wind, light, shadow, and other similar aspects of nature all possess Foundational True Names. These True Names, unlike most, are often short, and are more used to describe an entire 'grouping' of elements, with very little variation between differing members of the same name. Furthermore, entire genuses of species have been found to possess the same Foundational True Name, only varying further in additional words to distinguish individuals. Lastly, Foundational True Names also apply to concepts, which bear no physical form, but can be attributed all the same. The idea of something being "sharp", for example, would bear the Foundational True Name of sharpness, and so on and so forth. 

### Compositional

Compositional True Names are those that belong to non-naturally occurring elements, or to those who are not born of the world, but of aspects already present. For example, a refined steel ingot would possess a Compositional True Name by merit of being formed from two Foundational elements: iron and carbon. In the latter example's case, a child born of two Khadali parents may share the Khadali True Name, but have a unique Compositional True Name all of their own. These names are often lengthy and heavily descriptive, used to describe more or less every facet of their bearer in detail. In certain cultures and religions, the aspects of one's True Name are often analyzed and used to predict the person one would eventually grow into, although this has little bearing in actual studies. 

### Embodiments

While rare, there are many documented cases where an individual may be born, or even artifically altered, to possess a Compositional True Name that is often shorter, and more closely resembling those of Foundational True Names. In extreme cases, they may even match each other with upwards of 70-80% accuracy. These individuals are thusly termed Embodiments, forces of nature born into mortal form. Embodiments are uniquely capable of manipulating their corresponding element with tremendous ease, even from birth, likening it to simply another part of themselves. This does not seem to affect their individualism in any negative way, as well. 

## Will

>*"Those who possess True Names, may eventually come to understand themselves, and feel themselves. It is the truest form of oneself, sentience manifest. It is what we like to call... our Will."* - Silver Sage Norma Ava, *Will and the Language of Magic*

A mysterious power both intrinsic and separate from the Language of Magic, the Will of any being denotes its ability to persevere. It is a very literal measure of their soul's strength, the desire to thrive, and a manifestation of their deepest prayers. It is through the power of the WIll that any unliving bearer of a True Name may gain an imperfect sentience, brought on by this strange power. It is the principle which several forms of Magic are built off of, and the Spectrum phenomenon also seems deeply tied to it. Why is exists, however, is a mystery all the same.


## [[Extant Uses of The Language of Magic]]

Following the above rules on the usage of True Names and the Language of Magic, various unique and distinctive forms of Magic are used widely throughout the world, all of whom are still practiced in the modern day.
