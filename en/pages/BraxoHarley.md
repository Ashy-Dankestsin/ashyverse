#### Personality and History
A senior knight with a jovial personality and large presence, Brax o' Harley hails from a small rural village near Cassadin's Cape. As a young man, he journeyed east to endure the harsh trainings of knighthood, eventually becoming a respected and well-known knight among Willowshire's ranks. Though he has since left active service as a Campaign Knight, he continues to offer his services to the people as a guard for Carisellia, keeping his jolly jauntiness the whole way through.

Brax is a joyful and boisterous middle-aged man, seemingly always clad in a heavy, hulking suit of armor. Somewhat of a titan of his species, his mighty stature is only dwarfed by his love for all things Willowshire, a patriotism he is not afraid to show. Known for his repertoire of bad jokes, his genuine good advice, and his overall friendliness, he is a common recommendation for young squires to train with, learning the ins and outs of Citadel guardianship.

A lover of animals, as well, Brax owns not one, not two, but 5 cats, and is often quite open in sharing their cuteness to those he interacts with. Somewhat of a doting husband as well towards his partner, he never had children of his own, and thus treats any young knight or traveler in his presence as a surrogate, showering them with thoughtful insight and many a fresh meal. 

Though he claims to love all of Great Willowshire, it is not the absolute truth. Indeed, his true care lies in the people. His opinion of Knighthood lies with guardianship, and protecting those who cannot protect themselves. To him, a nation IS its people, and allowing small roots to bud and flourish is his life's goal. It is for that reason, perhaps, that he abandoned his travels to remain within the nation itself.

#### Skills
**Ironfist Combat: Full-Body Style**
A member of Great Willowshire's somewhat infamous Order of the Ironfist, Brax has shirked any skill with a sword in favor of his true favorite pasttime, mixed martial arts. With fists, kicks, and massive belly presses, he makes the most of his large size and larger armor, breaking through enemy lines with sheer force alone, and barrelling through and crushing everything in his path.

**Embodiment of Torque**
One of many Embodiments in Orbis that exist, Brax has an innate mastery over a more physical concept rather than anything more natural; that being Torque. This ability allows him to generate rotational force in objects as he wills, which has only further supplemented his incredibly brutal style of combat. By generating rotations on his own bulky, yet airy, armor, he is capable of bulldozing across enemy lines like a speeding bullet, creating enough energy to bunker through even the toughest of attacks. His title of "Wrecker Knight" is born from this characteristic method of combat, analogous to a wrecking ball.

**Domestic Skills**
A dedicated husband and all-around family guy, Brax is very versed in cooking, cleaning, and all around housekeeping. It had been a hobby since his youth, and he has certainly honed it to precision.
