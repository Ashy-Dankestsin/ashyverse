# The Art of Magic

![](https://i.imgur.com/o8dPhxH.png "The Art of Magic")

>*"Ask yourself this:  Why limit yourself to the mundane normality of the spoken word, echoing reality all the same? The mind is endless, a fountain of boundless imagination, creativity bursting at its seams. The shouting of our minds demand an outlet, yet how would you ever visualize the fantastic impossible with known sterility? Let it all out. The rest need not understand; the feeling is enough."*
>- Andreia of Ulri, *Analyses and Dissection of Art: The Meaning of Painting*

Thought lost beyond recognition is the Art of Magic, a skill entirely separate from the Language and Song of Magic. Where the Language and Song focus on linguistic applications through Evocation and Invocation and their extant uses, the Arts shirk any and all form of rule-abiding. Hinged solely on the caster's ability to imagine, the Art of Magic is unrestrained by natural law, and defined by rules that seem near limitless. 

Also referred to as "Witchcraft", practitioners are dubbed Witches, and were regarded as outcasts for attempting to sidestep the natural order. Even Silver Sage Arion, a proponent of researching lost human magics and relative fanatic of magic, was against the growing interest in the Art of Magic, and ordered the Witches to leave her nation. From here, the Witches themselves seemed to have a falling-out, splitting into 3 factions based on the 3 forms of Magecraft they had discovered under the Art of Magic's umbrella. 

Each Magecraft form is defined by a unique way in which it shatters preconceived beliefs of magical limitation, and all seem to draw from a mysterious source, regarded by most as the Boundary. The melding of reality with the fantastical creating a dominion which all Witches can tap into, but none can ever truly leave.

The preferred brand of Witchcraft for the White Witches, the group most dedicated to forging a mutually beneficial bond with those who lived with the Language of Magic. Coinciding with this notion, White Mystics are the most closely tied to the standards of the Language of Magic, following very similar rules to Evocations and Sorcery. Where it differs, however, is the elements it can manipulate. For a long time, it had been thought impossible to bend the world's foundations; though rock and earth could be moved, time and space could not. The White Mystics shatter this notion.

Unlike the other forms of the Art of Magic, White Mystics still require vocal Evocation to cast, although the specific language form used has varying linguistic tics. Through this Art, White Witches can pool pure concentrated energy from the Boundary source, allowing them to briefly but effectively ignore dimensional limits. Those versed in this form of Magecraft can tap into dimensions higher than the limited 3rd dimension in which the world exists, allowing them powers that completely shatter the limits of reality itself. Instant teleportation, spatial rending, time slowing and even stopping. Those who utilize the White Mystics, if strong enough, can even shift temporarily into the 4th dimension and beyond, becoming semi-imperceivable to those around them.

Though powerful, a greater understanding of sciences is required to fully utilize the White Mystics. There is little sentience to the powers granted by this form of Witchcraft, and a lack of knowledge in how to utilize it can yield disastrous consequences for the caster as they phase through the membrane of existence. It is not uncommon for White Witches to completely vanish for years on end, sealed through their own power in a dimension they cannot understand and cannot control.

## Black Arts

___

> - ???, *The Boundary*
___
**Magic Type**: Non-Verbal
**Magic Base**: The Art of Magic
**Specialization**: Creation of Unknown Sentient Beings, Violation of Biological Limitations
___

Used by the reclusive Black Witches, Black Arts are likely the most disruptive and chaotic brand of Witchcraft. Bound by no material limit, it is the pure art of materialization, bringing forth objects that have no logical foundation in reality. In particular, the true strength of Black Arts lies in a violation of the natural order; the ability to manifest cognizant, breathing entities that cannot and should not exist.

The fundamentals of Black Arts are, as its name implies, through artistic representation. Any form of physical art, be it sculpting, painting, dancing, etc. can be used as a catalyst through which the Witchcraft is formed. Though dissimilar to White Mystics, it too channels the mysterious Mana of the Boundary, utilizing its pure form within the artforms they produce. Black Arts are generally considered a form of expressionism, a realization of a Black Witch's desires, made reality through their strange patron. 

Once the catalyst has been fully designed or performed, a Black Witch need only touch their creation to bring it to life, creating entities with no place in reality, creatures known as Abstractions. There are no rules or laws that determine what an Abstraction should look like; their appearance, abilities, and even level of sentience are entirely at the whims of their creators. The sole rule is a degree of loyalty all Abstractions seem to possess towards their makers, as well as a chalky aura that seems to surround them, likely a byproduct of the substance they were born from.

As Abstractions and Black Arts are rooted in physical arts, it is necessary for a degree of personality and intent to be behind their creation. Shoddy work and soulless art would not produce any coherent entity, regardless of how good it may look. A Black Witch can also be severely harmed by the summoning process if they do not possess a strong Will, as with all forms of Witchcraft.

The Witchcraft utilized by the separated and often individualistic Red Witches, Red Magic operates on a much deeper level of communication with the Boundary than Black Arts or White Mystics. Where these other forms of Witchcraft tap into its powers but briefly, Red Magic focuses on communion and true synergy, melding one's entire being into the Boundary fold to gain the favor of its residents.

Considered the most heretical form of the already-heretical Witchcraft, Red Witches are often directly supported by an extradimensional 'patron', a sentient entity from outside reality who, in exchange for anything it may desire, allows a Red Witch to channel its powers for their own use. These powers are often powerful and mind-bending, and are unique in that they offer little backlash to the caster, unlike their other counterpart Witchcrafts. These links between a Red Witch and their patron are generally called "Contracts", being likened to ancient forms of demonology found in texts outside Continental Atheria. 

For as long as a Red Witch lives, they will be bound, body and soul, to their patron. Patrons may either offer fleeting advice from their manifold homes, or possess physical objects to remain in direct communion with their hosts. The nature of a contract is also entirely dependent on the Witch and patron, and no two contracts will really look the same. Should the terms of a contract be broken, a Red Witch will likely just disintegrate on the spot, though it is not unheard of for their patrons to subsequently take control of their body for the rest of their lives.
