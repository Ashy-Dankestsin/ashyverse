#### Personality and History
Great Faerie of the Lake, Mother of the Founding Knight, Patron of the prestigious House Du Lac. A thousand titles have been given to Nimue, yet none on their own could truly encompass what she represents in Continental Atheria. One of the oldest Faerie to have been born, and eldest of the 3 Great Faeries, she is the physical manifestation of her homeland's history, recorded in the eyes of a mother who has watched generations come and go, safe in her gentle embrace. 

Gentle and caring, Nimue is, as much as one could imagine, a mother. Though detached from the society she helped create, she is revered almost as a goddess, an icon of beauty, grace, and motherly love. For the love she is given by her countrymen, she returns in blessings and protection, a stalwart and immovable guardian that guides all knights along a road of chivalry, granting them boons and blessings to aide them on their quests.

Having watched entire civilizations come and go in her time, Nimue holds a deep respect and understanding of history, and with it wisdom that befits her age. At times her knowledge may seem limitless, capable of recounting in a melodic tone vast battles that had taken place prior to, during, and after Willowshire's inception. More than anything, however, is her dedication to her son Lancelot's memory. At a whim, she took in an orphaned boy and raised him into a valiant symbol of chivalry, and not a single living person could claim to be a bigger fan of him than Nimue herself. And maybe Galehaut.

Nimue is a sweet and calm woman, never one to be shocked, and always open to lend a helping hand. However, even with her exposure to Lancelot's journey, she struggles to comprehend several human emotions; her birthright was from nature, and therefore she lacks distinctly human expressions of the self, which has caused more than a few confusing moments in her time. Nevertheless, she remains as motherly as can be, and even enjoys decent amounts of TLC for anyone who steps into her domain.

To make an ally of Nimue is to fight with the tides at your side, but to make an enemy of her is said to equal the weight of the ocean, bearing down upon you. Though often suppressed in her years, Nimue commands a menacing dose of bloodlust, which only makes itself apparent when she enters true combat. Wielding her sword-staff as an extension of herself, and dancing amidst splashes of divine water and mortal blood, those little few who have seen this side of Nimue equate her as much of an icon of war as an icon of grace.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic**

As with all Faerie, Nimue was born inherently capable of speaking the Language of Magic. However, for many of the words, she lacks the intent required to actually Invoke Magecraft to a significant degree. Even so, her many years alive have granted her a rather extensive and versatile vocabulary, one she uses unquestionably for her nation's benefit.

Her personal mastery in the Language of Magic is, of course, water. Commanding the tides like the Moons themselves, she is capable of everything from whipping and reshaping water into useful tools, or just diverting the currents of entire streams and rivers. Her greatest feat, one spoken of in Willowian legend to this day, was when she diverted an entire sea to create space for the nation to flourish, an act seen almost as divine intervention when it was really just a mother being far too doting.

**Embodiment of Water**

Her mastery of commanding water stems not just from her skill in the Language of Magic, however, but also in her nature as an Embodiment of such. It is said the 3 Great Faeries govern the cardinal elements that make up Great Willowshire, with water being one of them, and Nimue certainly proves such. With a breath, she is able to grant magical blessings onto any amount of water, enchanting lakes and rivers with life and radiance. For the knights who serve under her, she provides all of them with vials of this mystical water, of whom possess names and limited sentience of their own, to serve as aides to their companions. So powerful is this command of water that for those caught unaware, Nimue can well manipulate even their bodies to an extent, enforcing authority over even the molecular composites of a mortal body. Though she doesn't do this very often.

**Du Lac Swordsmanship: Mastery**

It is often said in history that the Du Lac school of swordsmanship was founded by the Founding Knight Lancelot. Though this is true, it is usually skipped over that the one who trained Lancelot in this combat style was his own mother, Nimue. Though her weapon can hardly be called a true sword, she is nevertheless incredibly adept at using it in combat. A combination of pierces, slashes, and spinning strikes lends to a style both similar yet unfamiliar to the school of Du Lac Swordsmanship. Nevertheless, the roots of the style are clear, and Nimue is the uncontested master of this brand of combat.
