# Magecraft
The use of the Language of Magic in day-to-day life is often termed Magecraft by the masses. Through various methods, the Language can be channeled in order to accomplish basically any task. Magecraft itself, however, is far from simple, and follows a branching pathway that becomes more and more complex the further down you go. 

At its core, Magecraft is split into 3 levels: Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advanced. The vast majority of the Language of Magic's Advanced techniques and forms have been outlawed by the Judiciary, though records of them still remain, despite their best efforts to hide such.

Fundamental - Magecraft taught in common curriculum. More or less any person would have some understanding of these Magecraft forms.

Intermediate - Magecraft taught to scholars and combatants, or anyone who wishes to pursue studies in Magecraft further. Most people would end their studies here, as the scope of knowledge within Intermediate Magecraft is nigh-limitless.

Advanced - Highly advanced Magecraft, often only discovered through independent and extensive study, and requiring deep knowledge of The Language of Magic to even comprehend. Most have been outlawed by the Judiciary.

# Fundamental
___
## Evocation

![](https://i.imgur.com/dsIoCIs.png "Evocation")
___
>*"A outward manifestation of the form and soul of a True Name, called on by vocalization. One could consider it a forceful alteration of physical space, a bending of natural law by words to serve your will."* 
>- Silver Sage Mahal, *Evocation: Principles and Logic*
___
**Magic Type**: Fundamental
**Magic Base**: The Language of Magic
**Specialization**: Creation of Known Elements
___

One of the most common forms of Magecraft in Continental Atheria, and perhaps all of Orbis. Evocation is the practice of calling out a True Name in order to manifest its form or properties in physical space. It function as a root point for many different forms of Magecraft, and is used by almost everyone in the world.

The use of Evocation is termed "Evoking", and is used both domestically and for combat, although it is most often used for training to achieve an Intermediate level of Magecraft. Nevertheless, Evocation is an important fundamental for aspiring combatants to learn.

___
## Invocation

![](https://i.imgur.com/tnvI4cW.png "Invocation")
___
>*"A shifting of an object's internal composition, altered to suit a user's needs. Through vocalizing a True Name, it may be imbued into the very soul of the object, transforming its natural state into a foreign form. Perhaps there may be a way to apply this for weaponry?"*
> - Silver Sage Mahal, *Invocation: Principles and Logic*
___
**Magic Type**: Fundamental
**Magic Base**: The Language of Magic
**Specialization**: Infusion of Known Elements
___

Another of the most common forms of Magecraft. Invocation is the practice of channeling a True Name, and its respective properties, into another object. This process results in the original object being granted the physical and/or magical properties of the associated True Name, though in most cases can result in the original object dissipating altogether. Not as common as Evocation, Invocation is markedly more important as a fundamental Magecraft for combatants, infusing their weapons with such elements as fire, wind, etc, and as such as seen much use around the world.

The use of Invocation is termed "Invoking", and like Evocation is also used both domestically and for combat, mainly as an intermediary stage of Magecraft development to reach new heights. Nevertheless, its fundamental concepts are incredibly important for some of the strongest forms of Magecraft, and to understand it is vital.

# Intermediate
___
## Sorcery

![](https://i.imgur.com/R1W2zef.png "Sorcery")
___
>*"Magic of Creation. It is the manipulation of Evoked elements for extended use, with a seemingly endless variance of such. The ancient texts proved very helpful for uncovering even more of its secrets..."*
> - Silver Sage Mahal, *Extant Applications of the Language of Magic*
___
**Magic Type**: Intermediate
**Magic Base**: Evocation
**Specialization**: Creation and Manipulation of Known Elements
___

An extant form of the Language of Magic, derived from Evocation, is Sorcery. Sorcery is the practice of Evoking elements, and then applying adjective or verb extensions to the Evoked True Name in order to manipulate it for various purposes. A classic case of easy to learn, hard to master, Sorcery has far-reaching and far-branching applications that could take any sorcerer an eternity to even fully learn. 

The act of using Sorcery is often dubbed Spellcasting, and the extensive string of words spoken for Evocation is referred to as a Spell. The only rule of Sorcery is that a True Name need still exist as a noun, but any permutation of adjectives and verbs is allowed so long as a caster can withstand the pushback. Examples may include:
- Attaching "Spear" as an adjective and "Fast-moving" as a verb to an Evocation of Fire creates a spell that flings fire in the shape of a spear at high speeds.
- Attaching "Sticky" as an adjective to an Evocation of Water creates water that possesses sticky properties.
- Attaching "Rotating" as a verb to an Evocation of Earth creates a rock that rotates.
This general rule is maintained throughout any and all possible spells created under Sorcery.

___
## Augmentation

![](https://i.imgur.com/dDcgx3O.png "Augmentation")
___
>*"Reinforcing an object may seem simple, but the arduous task of manipulating Augmentation is no easy matter. To retain the form of the original object while still applying a slew of new properties is the mark of a trained and experienced craftsman."*
> - Silver Sage Mahal, *Extant Applications of the Language of Magic*
___
**Magic Type**: Intermediate
**Magic Base**: Invocation
**Specialization**: Infusion of Known Elements as Reinforcement
___

Although very similar in essence to Invocation, the process of Augmentation refers to the controlled manipulation of Invoked elements, such that an object can retain its original properties while still benefitting from new elemental traits being added onto it. Deep experience is needed to ensure an Augmentation process does not destroy its base components in the process, and the Augmenter may utilize a variety of primarily adjectives to produce the suitable dosage of any element needed or desired.

Objects that have been worked upon are termed "Augmented", and the process itself shares the same name as the base term, Augmentation. The science hidden in the crevasses of the Augmenting process are complex and well-studied, and it is up to the individual to truly master the appropriate ratios through studying or trial-and-error, in order to produce a satisfactory Augment. Such examples may include:
- Augmenting a steel sword with Fire, at a low enough concentration that the fire would not melt the steel, but high enough that it can produce a heating effect along the blade.
- Augmenting one's own arms with Blacksteel, often used by soldiers of Grand Boreas. A suitable dosage is required to ensure joint movement is still viable, and that the arm can still be reverted afterwards.
- Augmenting a polearm with a "Fast" verb. Verbs are not often used for Augmentation, but on rare occasions may produce a decent result. In this case, the polearm would feel less restricted by air pushback, and thus be faster.

___
## Alchemy

![](https://i.imgur.com/YMoQ7jd.png "Alchemy")
___
>*"Utilizing our analyses of material composition, and combining both Evocation and Invocation, we have developed a process for the artificial alteration of elements. This, we have dubbed as Alchemy."*
> - Silver Sage Mahal, *Extant Applications of the Language of Magic*
___
**Magic Type**: Intermediate
**Magic Base**: Evocation, Invocation
**Specialization**: Conversion of Known Elements, Creation of Unknown Elements
___

A form of Magecraft developed during a resource-scarce period of history, Alchemy was created as a final hope for many ailing civilizations, a process which allowed for material conversion to make up the windfall caused by a lack of vital resources. By the process of Invocation, one could feasibly attach new properties into a material at specific ratios. At the same time, utilizing Evocation would allow for physical mixing and molding of multiple materials. The combination of these two fundamentals created a Magecraft which could reconstruct non-living materials from the inside-out, transforming it into an entirely new material altogether.

Alchemy is a process that is both arduous or fast. It is accepted that the more complex a material's composition, in particular its True Name composition, the more difficult it will be to alter and mold into a desired form. For simple materials like dirt, sand, or stone, an Alchemizing process can be quick and efficient, but on the other hand, it can take several skilled Alchemists upwards of a few days to even convert a small slab of iron into chunks of unrefined gold.

In most cases, one would not expect a special term be granted to elements copied via Alchemy, as the main purpose is to create an exact indistinguishable replica. However, "Alchemized" materials, as they are usually termed, refers specifically to unique materials developed through Alchemy that have not been found anywhere in the natural world. Despite the daunting process, the benefits of Alchemy and its creations have had major impacts upon the world. Examples include:
- Liquid Fire, a viscous form of natural fire that also possesses all properties of water, and has been a major factor in energy production.
- Orichalcum, a highly durable metal compound that is entirely rust-resistant, and capable of cutting through even deep ocean rocks.
- Silver Glass, a unique material developed when Liquid Fire was heavily inserted into molding sand. Rigid, lightweight, yet highly fragile under stress.

___
## Naturamancy

![](https://i.imgur.com/BQWQSpe.png "Naturamancy")
___
>*"From material creation, comes manipulation. One can only imagine the applications possible with such a powerful technique... The ability to bend even the unbreathing world to your will."*
> - Silver Sage Arwen, *The Miracles of Humanity*
___
**Magic Type**: Intermediate
**Magic Base**: Alchemy, Sorcery
**Specialization**: Manipulation of Existing Elements and the Natural Order
___

Fluid and limitless, the natural evolution from manipulating elements which one creates themselves is to manipulate the elements that exist all around you. Naturamancy is the practice of applying direct verb-and-adjective additions to natural objects in the world to shift them and use them to fulfill desired actions. Often times without even making contact, a skilled Naturamancer can command the earth beneath them to shift into sharp rock eruptions, or to change the flow of a river to charge down enemies.

Powerful as it is, Naturamancy is heavily reliant on a user's familiarity with the Language of Magic. Requiring quick reflexes and fast chanting, efficient use of this form of Magecraft can be few and far between, and it often takes years for any spellcaster to truly master this technique. However, the potential uses of Naturamancy by those skilled few is nigh-infinite. It is often thought that the highest skill ceiling of Naturamancy lies in the ancient fables and legends of mythical beings and famous figures, such as:
- Shifting landmasses and sprouting entire forests, as was done by the Horned God Cernunnos to create Great Willowshire.
- Manipulating weather patterns, such as the Magecraft of Ash-Prince Luhal during the legendary Astoran Coast War. 
- Bending large portions of the ocean and redirecting water flows, the primary authority of the Great Faerie of the Lake, Nimue.

___
## Therianthropy

![](https://i.imgur.com/V45awI8.png "Therianthropy")
___
>*"Calling upon the form of beasts to Infuse yourself with, granting their strengths and powers, but their weaknesses, as well. As well as the mental state... more research should be done with this, Mahal."*
> - Silver Sage Katleiya, Letter addressed to Silver Sage Mahal, recovered from personal files
___
**Magic Type**: Intermediate
**Magic Base**: Alchemy, Augmentation
**Specialization**: Manipulation of the Self into Bestial Form
___

Considered one of the riskiest forms of Magecraft to the self, the practice of Therianthropy is the Invocation of animalistic True Names into oneself or objects they possess, granting them the limited form of said animal. Whether it affects only parts of one's body, or the entire self, is entirely reliant on the limitations of the user. When in bestial form, a caster may possess the strengths, weaknesses, as well as even the natural magics used by the beast they have become, making Therianthropy a much sought-after form of Magecraft for those with naturally frail physiques and/or those with physical ailments.

However, the strength of Therianthropy is directly proportionate to its risks, as well. Not just from the inherent weaknesses of certain animals, but also in the mental state of the user; Invoking the True Names of animals into your own body also Invokes the primal brain-state of said animal, which can result in brutal adverse effects on the user depending on how long the transformation lasts, and how much of the body was transformed. Singular limbs transformed for a short period of time pose little risk to the user, but full-body transformations, or Therianthropy targeted around a user's head, carry significant risk of damaging a user's mental state. In extreme cases, it may even lead to the brain of the Invoked animal overtaking the user's mind, turning them into a pure beast. This risk is not present if Therianthropy is performed on inanimate objects, as the object will often just take the behavioral patterns of the animal directly.

Examples of Therianthropy's usages are somewhat rare, but it is most commonly used for Animachairs, special devices used by those with mobility impairments and disabilities for all-terrain locomotion.

## Golemancy

![](https://i.imgur.com/RWxGpaH.png "Golemancy")
___
>*"It is human instinct to believe ourselves God."*
> - Silver Sage Arion
___
**Magic Type**: Advanced
**Magic Base**: Alchemy, Sorcery, Naturamancy
**Specialization**: Imbuement of Life into Inanimate Materials
___

One of the most advanced forms of Magecraft, as well as one thought lost to the sands of time. The art of Golemancy involves channeling sentience into inanimate material, traditionally either clay or stone, in order to bring it to life in a specific form. Bending the properties of Magecraft itself, it relies on Sorcery to create and manipulate an essential aspect of life, Naturamancy to form a suitable vessel from living but inanimate base materials, and Alchemy to refine and fully fuse the two together. This results in the creation of a Golem.

Golems have no specific form, size, material, or any of the sort. The term itself is simply a catch-all to refer to any being brought to life through Golemancy. They are often mute, but are capable of understanding commands and acting on their own will to execute said commands. Golems are traditionally made mostly subservient to the caster who created them, although it is not unheard of to make an entirely independent Golem who follows its own orders. Depending on whatever modifications had been made to their physical body prior to animation, a Golem can possess any degree of strength, but traditionally are never able to use the Language of Magic, mainly as a limitation of their inability to formulate vocal speech.

Golemancy as a practice had long been outlawed by the Judiciary, and has since faded into obscurity. Very few still dare to attempt to research its history and applications, due to the inherent dangers of birthing sentient living beings in the forms of unbreathing materials. Though somewhat similar to the act of Therianthropy on objects, Golemancy does not rely on animal instinct or True Names (though those can be implemented), instead seeming to function off an even more metaphysical concept of the Soul.

___
## Astromancy

![](https://i.imgur.com/ovG28SK.png "Astromancy")
___
>*"Lo, o starlight. In your light we live, in your embrace we die. Bear up our selves, with shimmering resplendence. O starlight, gentle starlight, please dwell within our eyes."*
> - Sacred message of the Church of the Star Mother, passed down from Silver Sage Norma Ava
___
**Magic Type**: Advanced
**Magic Base**: Alchemy, Therianthropy, Augmentation
**Specialization**: Worship and Channeling of Starborne Entities
___

A long-held sacred art of Magecraft, currently practiced only by acolytes of the Church of the Star Mother. Astromancy is the reading, analysis, and conjuring of star-streaked patterns in the sky. A Magecraft native to the Farlands of Astelle, it was thought to be discovered by the Silver Sage Norma Ava, who called it the power to channel starlight as your own. The use of Astromancy relies heavily on the existence of the Constella, powerful beings born from fused starlight, created by belief in their existence. Though Augmentation, starlight itself is made tangible, and infused into one's body through the ocular nerves as a catalyst; from there, Therianthropy is used to bend the animalistic features of the Constella into appropriate augments throughout the body, after which Alchemy is used to properly fuse the traits together to create a living armor of starlight.

The movement of stars across the sky is tied intrinsically to the metaphysical flow of time; as such, practitioners of Astromancy, dubbed Astromancers, are capable of visualizing the very literal flow of time with their eyes, as well. Through the ebb and flow of the Constella, and their aging, a master Astromancer could even predict the future, albeit briefly. However, this act is often tantamount to self-mutilation, as the process in which to alter one's eyes to observe this flow results in permanent blindness. Nevertheless, elder acolytes of the Church of the Star Mother are often seen with blindfolds or sunglasses, specially designed to better facilitate the channeling of starlight into their eyes.

In short, the practice of Astromancy is reliant on one's eyes and strength of faith, hence why it has mostly transitioned into a Magecraft used wholly for purposes of the Church. 

___
## Necrovocation

![](https://i.imgur.com/EpZKwAJ.png "Necrovocation")
___
>*"Disruption of eternal peace in favor of an undying grudge."*
> - Silver Sage Arion
___
**Magic Type**: Advanced
**Magic Base**: Golemancy, Astromancy
**Specialization**: Revival and Manipulation of the Dead
___

A Magecraft whose practice and use was limited even in the days of Fel Ardonia, Necrovocation nevertheless has cemented itself in history as one of the Language of Magic's darkest elements. A practice that attempts communion and command of the dead, Evoking memories and existences recorded in starlit time via Astromancy and channeling their spirits into an unholy resurrection through Golemancy, creating an Undead. 

Though there are various ways in which an Undead may appear, depending on the stage of decomposition and/or damage down to the body, they are characterized by a dark black fog that hangs over them, an indicator that their existence should by all rights be limited. Indeed, for most Undeads, they can only speak and move for a limited period of time, before natural order rejects their existence, and forcibly ends the connection. Attempts to use Alchemy to bond the spirit and body tighter have proved ineffective, usually resulting in a forceful, violent rupturing of the body. 

However, depending on the force of Will possessed by the Invoked spirit, it is possible for Undeads to persist for lengthy periods of time, far longer than the average. In such cases, it is often that a different vessel by used instead of the host body, performed through a transition rite to avoid the latent decomposition and physical strain caused by Necrovocation on cadavers. Despite the dark connotations hanging over this practice, several locations hold reverence and respect for it, often performing traditional rites to allow the dead to speak their final words to loved ones, as is common in Ulri.
