# Magecraft

Note: Read [[The Language of Magic]] before continuing, as certain concepts will be mentioned with assumptions of understanding the basic principles.

The use of the Language of Magic in day-to-day life is often termed Magecraft by the masses. Through various methods, the Language can be channeled in order to accomplish basically any task. Magecraft itself, however, is far from simple, and follows a branching pathway that becomes more and more complex the further down you go. 

At its core, Magecraft is split into 3 levels: Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advanced. The vast majority of the Language of Magic's Advanced techniques and forms have been outlawed by the Judiciary, though records of them still remain, despite their best efforts to hide such.

## Fundamental

>*"A outward manifestation of the form and soul of a True Name, called on by vocalization. One could consider it a forceful alteration of physical space, a bending of natural law by words to serve your will."* - Silver Sage Mahal, *Evocation: Principles and Logic*
**Magic Type**: Fundamental
**Magic Form**: The Language of Magic
**Specialization**: Creation of Known Elements

Of the methods of manipulating the Language of Magic, Evocation is the most standard form, that being the act of calling out the True Name of an element and manipulating its manifested form in whichever way the user desires. This process, dubbed Evoking, is used worldwide in anything from household applications to high-tier combat. 

Evocation is a very freeform method of using the Language of Magic, withheld by very few limitations beyond the requirement to verbalize and pronounce the desired words properly. From manifesting balls of fire, to summoning river rapids, or erupting boiling magma from one's hands, the potential of Evocation remains nigh endless.

Additionally, advanced techniques of Evocation may also allow for the addition of descriptors or adjectives to augment and supplement Evoked spellcraft, at the cost of increased difficulty in chanting their full Name. Examples may include "Large" as an additive to increase the physical mass of a conjured element, or "Fast" to speed up its rate of fire.

>*"Reinforcement of an object's internal composition, altered and augmented to suit a user's needs. Through vocalizing a True Name, it may be imbued into the very soul of the object, transforming its natural state into a foreign form."* - Silver Sage Mahal, *Invocation: Principles and Logic*

Another common form of the Language of Magic, Invocation is centered around the vocalization of True Names as a form of augmentation, rather than for direct combat. By calling for a True Name to be implanted into an object, it is possible to directly channel the powers of that Name into said object, a process known as Invocation.

As a fairly simple application of the Language, Invocation is also uninhibited by much beyond pronunciation. However, to use it on a living being is incredibly arduous compared to inanimate objects. Most True Names, even those of concepts, can be Invoked into objects, granting them similar properties. The essence of Invocation, therefore, is in maintaining the original state of the object while still granting it these foreign powers.

Unlike what might be assumed, Invocation is also not entirely bound to needing a physically hold an object to apply. The process of Invoking a True Name depends entirely on one's ability to maintain focus, and should a caster be experienced enough they may be able to Invoke elements into far-off objects, as well. However, it is generally accepted that the limit lies in whether a clear line of sight can be maintained.
