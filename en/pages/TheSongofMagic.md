>*"One would think it logical that where language exists, song must as well. This is no philosophical concept; songs are universal, that is all. Thusly, the Language of Magic must also have its analogue... Apologies. I must stop here. I feel strangely tired..."*
>Diary of Amii, 32nd and Final Chief of Pulagunu

From the cradle which bore the Language of Magic, its usage in song has also been analyzed and perpetuated to a degree around the world. Once thought lost, this ancient form of magic was used by traditional Songspeakers from Pulagunu, the Island of Songs situated in the Nagabula Archipelago, particularly in their famous Elegy of Stars. 

Derived from the Language of Magic, the Song of Magic utilizes the same grammatical structures as the language, and does not deviate much from the vocabulary often used in spellcraft. However, there is one distinction; true to its name, the Song of Magic must utilize an external melody to truly function, and the tone of the music greatly affects the properties of the magic. 

The actual properties of the Song of Magic greatly varies from standard Evocations of the Language of Magic. Far less versatile, yet incredibly powerful, the Song of Magic embodies the concept of "restoration". When sung properly, they are capable of restoring their verses back into form, in almost the same manner as reversing time. Such applications may include healing wounds, repairing structures, and other similar uses.

However, the form of magic has been mostly eradicated, due to its other properties. Through its restoration, the Song of Magic is capable of returning entire concepts to the world, and is even capable of imprinting and replacing segments of the world with its lost songs. The Snake God Incident, still remembered to this day for how it ravaged the Nagabula Isles, stands as a testament of the dangers the Song of Magic is capable of. 

In recent days, the Song of Magic has long been outlawed by the Judiciary, never to be used unless in extreme circumstances. Though its miracles were plentiful, so too was its applications to create harm, or so was said by the Nightsage of the Judiciary.
