>*United as one around our round table, we await our King upon a gilded throne. We are founded under the moonlit blade of the First Knight, and consecrated in the mystics of the Fae. From amidst the woodlands of yore, we stand joyous as our capital, resolute as the tides, in the embrace of our Lake Mother. Glory to our home, Great Willowshire.* 

A nation founded by the Clearsword Knight Lancelot, a nomadic knight later known as the First Knight, who united his birthplace's war-torn hamlets into a flourishing kingdom. Known to the outside world as the Forested Kingdom of Knights, it is a country founded on values of chivalry and knighthood, and many of its citizens pride themselves on their unity and powerful knights.

## Knights of Great Willowshire

The main schooling curriculum of Great Willowshire focuses on the training and learning of students into proud knights of their nation. Most will start out in basic schools, learning basic theorems of the world, before moving into specialized training in swordfighting, martial arts, spearfighting, and combat methods of a similar ilk. 
Students who have passed preliminary training are sent out as Squires, trainee knights to be placed under the jurisdiction of more experienced knights to receive on-field training. Squires must pass at minimum 5 designated trials codified by the Knight Lord Council and their assigned trainer knight before they are fully knighted, at which they may enter the world on their own.

Knights can be broadly categorized into one of 3 major Orders in Great Willowshire, these being:

#### Order of the Clearsword

The oldest and most prestigious order, founded by the First Knight during the earliest days of the nation. The Order of the Clearsword specializes in the Du Lac school of swordsmanship, the country's main curriculum. Naturally, they are versed primarily in swordfighting, mainly using longswords, broadswords, and rapiers. 
Knights of this order are often designated as national guards and the primary police force, stationed across various smaller towns and hamlets around the country to provide security and defense against bandits and/or wild monsters.

#### Order of the Ironfist

A boisterous order of knights who favor martial arts and blunt force weaponry over their Clearsword sibling knights. Founded much later by the legendary Ironfist Knight, a Knight Lord said to have brawled an ancient dragon with his bare hands in a glorious victory to protect his country. The Order of the Ironfist are masters of close-quarters combat, practicing no specific school of fighting. Others within their order may also be adept at blunt, heavy weapons like maces or hammers, or perhaps even shields.
Those of the Ironfist Order can be found almost everywhere, serving as frontliners in campaign groups or as heavy-duty protectors called in for particularly beefy adversaries. 

#### Order of the Stormrider

The most recent of the orders to be founded, yet also one of the most famous, and a favorite of young knights and horse girls. The Order of the Stormrider's founding follows a greatly mythologized (and greatly debated) story of the Stormrider Knight charging atop their steed into a raging thunderous storm, emerging days later after having dissipated and destroyed it from the inside out. Members of this order are versed in pole weapons, like spears and halberds, and are given unique training in horseback riding and combat, each being given a specialized horse to grow and train alongside.
Stormrider knights are the go-tos for many campaigns and expeditions given their mobility and ability to provide additional carry strength (with their horses), but they also serve as first responders to unforeseen crises within the nation.

## Greater Knights

Beyond the 3 major Orders of Knights, there are two groups of knights deemed the highest caliber, the cream of the crop. Those selected to become Knight Lords are generally only chosen from these distinct groups, being:

#### Citadel Knights

One of the highest order of knights, tasked primarily with guarding their nation from foreign and outside threats. Stationed all around the country, every Citadel Knight leads several smaller groups of knights, and is in charge of sending orders and dividing tasks among their surbordinates. Knights of this caliber carry great respect and authority within their nation, and only the most senior and capable knights are ever given this role by the Knight Lord Council. Of the seated chairs of the Council, 5 of them are designated Citadel Knights.

Wavebreaker Knight - tasked with majority internal affairs of the capital
Blackrock Knight - tasked with internal affairs of the nation at large
Skydancer Knight - tasked with management of local businesses and agriculture
Glorybringer Knight - tasked with foreign exchange, business relations, and communications with the Judiciary
Thunderclap Knight - tasked with management of police forces and peacekeeping

#### Campaign Knights

Matched in authority with the Citadel Knights are the Campaign Knights, the order of knights who organize and lead expeditions beyond the borders of the nation, scouting out treasures and expandable lands, and fending off external forces which may seek to harm their nation before they even get close. The influence of Campaign Knights are felt far and wide throughout the continent of Atheria, and they are often considered the reason for Willowshire's fame to the average person. Though not in charge of designated groups, a Campaign Knight can choose any number of willing knights to participate in their excursions, providing valuable experience to both old and new alike. Of the seated chairs of the Council, 5 Knight Lords are designated Campaign Knights, each tasked with mainly exploring one specific region in the world.

Mountainsplitter Knight - tasked with exploration of the Aster Plains, focusing on the Highlands
Ironheart Knight - tasked with exploration of the Aster Plains, focusing on the Northern Plains
Hollowflame Knight - tasked with exploration of the Nightwinter Snowfields, southwest of Kholsvyck
Deathmourn Knight - tasked with exploration of the Unnamed Isles near the rumoured location of Old Altum
Starfall Knight - tasked with exploration of the unknown regions south of the Silverlands
