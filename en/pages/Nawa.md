#### Personality and History
Hailing from the famed "Island of Songs", Pulagunu, Nawa is the youngest disciple to have inherited her town's famed singing, despite being born blind. However, tragedy struck, and she became the last survivor of the Silent Song incident, where her entire town perished in a collective dream brought on by heretical magic. Escaping from the dream with the help of her village elders, she would later join the Church of the Star Mother on mainland Nagabula, wherein she would found a new life as a wandering city bard, continuing the passions of her hometown.

Though her singing could be described as angelic, the girl herself is arguably anything but. Armed with the sharpest tongue on the archipelago and a wit to back it, Nawa never hesitates to strike friend and foe alike with proverbial knives. Her combination of youthful playfulness and cold-blooded sarcasm almost never discriminates, and Nawa herself seems to take an almost sadistic pleasure in brutalizing those who bother her with words. 

Despite her disability, she has never let her lack of sight affect her much, and often stresses she wouldn't be much different with eyesight. Using a specialized headdress provided to her by the Church of the Star Mother, she is able to make out rough outlines of objects and people around her through reflective starlight. Although it provides only a small boon, Nawa nevertheless appreciates it, and is almost never seen without it. Indeed, she has made her own ways to navigate the world.

From youth, Nawa has been raised on music and song, and as such often carries a very singsong tone to her speech and personality. She's somewhat of a free spirit, and finds her solace in providing musical entertainment to the masses without a care of much else. Though her talents stem from a deep-rooted passion, she certainly still enjoys the adoration she receives.

It's common for Nawa to flex her musical talents where she can, and she takes great pride in her ability to play any instrument and sing any song. She is also, unfortunately for the other musicians of the Isles, a brutal critic. Songwriting does not escape her sharp words, and in fact seem to be targeted by Nawa more than anything else. Perhaps it's her songwriter's pride, or just her sadism. Hard to say.

What sets Nawa apart from the stereotypical lax youth of the Isles is her determination, however. Though she certainly indulges in small leisures, the trauma of losing her entire life just a few years ago weighs heavy on the young girl, and she carries in her heart a burning passion to continue the traditions of her home. Ultimately, despite all her unorthodox 'pleasantries', she is still just a girl, and she finds silent peace in just being able to live as she is.

#### Skills
**The Song of Magic (Mastery)**

Nawa, and her hometown by extension, were practitioners of a lost art: The Song of Magic. Where much of magic is derived from speaking in its language, few could claim to sing in its mysterious, voiceless words. Nawa, however, is one such person. Though she keeps it under wraps, she has an incredible talent for vocalizing and forming melodies through the Language of Magic, perhaps an extension of her already latent musical talents. As the Song of Magic hinges on restoration, Nawa provides these talents in the form of healing and medical aide, mending broken bones and vicious slashes through her songs' mysterious properties.


**Analytic (Language of Magic)**

While not nearly as experienced as most, Nawa is also a decent analyst of the Language of Magic. Often used for decoding old scripts for song lyrics, her analytical talents have manifested slightly differently due to her lack of eyesight. Determining the shape of symbols through the aide of vocal descriptions (often from another person), she is able to roughly identify its prose and form in relation to the rest of the text, allowing Nawa an imperfect, yet unique interpretation of the lyrics and their meaning.

**Musical Talent**

Nawa is a bonafide musical maestro, and she does not hide it. From strings to percussions to everything in between, she is able to play just about any instrument to a masterful degree. Her personal favorite is the Rebab, a traditional string instrument of her hometown, and you will rarely see her without it. She seems to find the most pride in the traditional instruments of her home country for obvious reasons, and should she be asked on them, Nawa will often launch into hour-long explanations to convey their brilliance.
