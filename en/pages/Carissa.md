#### Personality and History
A former Patron Faerie to the now-defunct House Woodshire, Carissa bore witness to the disappearances of her entire house following an expedition gone wrong several decades ago. In her depression, she committed herself to self-exile from Great Willowshire and took roost in the Deepwoods, where her grief would manifest into spiraling thornbush walls, sealing herself away in a cocoon for what was intended to be eternity. However, the cheerful persistence of a young Volken girl persuaded her to release the thorns, and join her on her quest.

A victim of tragedy, Carissa is still recovering from the trauma of losing her entire family. Before meeting Noria, she would often suffer from delusions and hallucinations. Even now, Carissa deals with the occasional nightmare and general anxiety. Though her recovery is going smoothly, it is nevertheless a slow process, and those who knew her in the past note a stark gloominess has manifested around her in present day.

Introverted and shy by nature, Carissa is a demure woman, often hiding away from public spaces from fear of the crowds. Though she is capable of speaking to strangers, she finds it somewhat uncomfortable, and only does so in the most extreme circumstances, opting instead to simply shrink away into the background. Despite this, she is known to speak rather crassly and bluntly, contrasted only by the eloquence of her voice. 

Carissa is also rather critical of modern infrastructure and technology, and will always opt to use all-natural methods for cooking or healthcare where possible. Not that she's particularly good at either, though. Though Carissa touts herself as an aficionado on all things plantlife, her inherent physical constitution as a Faerie means that the deadliness of certain herbs when ingested tends to go unnoticed, until it may perhaps be too late.

For all of her introverted tendencies, anyone who gains Carissa’s trust will be met with an incredibly protective mother figure. Fiercely loyal to those she calls allies and children, Carissa would willingly cast aside every inhibition to protect them. She believes family to stand above all, and her faith manifests in an oft-unseen side of her; Confident and talkative, she can go on at length about the trust she’s cultivated. It is a side Carissa often finds embarrassing after the fact, and one would notice her hood worn tighter than usual for a few hours after.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic**

Being part of the ancient race of Faerie, Carissa possesses an inherent knowledge of the Language of Magic, not found in most practitioners of magecraft. Through her rather long lifespan, she has garnered a deep vocabulary of words and phrases, but her own seclusion to the Deepwoods has left Carissa somewhat unknowledgeable of more modern terms.

Carissa's own specialization in the Language of Magic is plant growth and vinework, manipulating the very soil and natural order around her. Roots and thorned vines are her specialty, but she is also capable of calling forth large amounts of foliage and other manner of plantlife. In most cases, she will often use her roots and vines to ensnare and lash out at approaching foes, as well as repositioning through the earth using a root-like network, making Carissa a rather disorienting combatant to fight. 

**Embodiment of the Woods**

As is inherent of all Faeries, Carissa is an Embodiment, specifically of woodlands. Her existence is inherently tied to forests and plantlife, and to remain close to such elements provides a massive boon to her vitality and strength. Communion with the unheard voices of the trees is also possible for her, granting Carissa a nigh-infinite surveillance system to which she can access in any wooded area. However, the inverse is also possible. In places without natural plantlife, Carissa will grow significantly weaker, often becoming lethargic and hazy in the most extreme cases, incapable of even speaking words, let alone casting spells.
