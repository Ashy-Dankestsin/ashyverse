#### Personality and History
The bastard son of Lord Henric Doveblossom IV, Oliver was ostracized from his noble house and society, a permanent reminder of his father's infidelity and black stain on his house's name. In his desperation, a young Oliver found refuge and acceptance amongst the scholars of Sky Mother's Domain. After a decade of studies in and out of the nation, he would return to his homeland with no love left for the nation, and a desire to root out its corruption, even if it meant its destruction.

A stoic and cynical young man, Oliver spent much of his life believing himself to be worthless. Despite the kind treatment he was given by his mentors in Sky Mother's Domain, he would only continue to internalize the ostracization he received from his noble-blooded peers. This has led to him developing a deeply apathetic streak; even at his best, he can only give wry responses to those around him, and subconsciously distances himself from even his closest confidants.

Incredibly well-read in the fields of politics and public speech, Oliver is a master of the spoken word. With wit, bravado, and a healthy (or unhealthy) dose of 'mental suggestion', he strikes powerful opinions into people who never knew they had such beliefs, and is capable of swaying almost anyone given enough time. Somewhat cruel in his applications of this talent, Oliver does not hesitate to deceive and half-truth his way into getting what he wants, even at the detriment of others. 

For a man who saw only the darkest sides of Great Willowshire's upper society, Oliver views the entire system as corrupt from the bottom up. Knighthood, therefore, is equally corrupt; the oath and creed to protect a broken system could only ever be broken itself, in his eyes. To this end, he does not view Knighthood at all as an ideology, but as a means to an end. It is authority, a national power to be abused and discarded when it no longer serves him.

Despite his darkest sides, Oliver sees a single light at the end of his tunnel; Morrigan, whom he had meet in their mutual studies in Sky Mother's Domain, reached out to him when he was in his darkest hours, offering solace and a budding friendship. It is in her dream that he sees his own; to change Great Willowshire. However, even this small comfort has been twisted by his darkest influences, and more than a shared dream, Oliver has turned it, and by extension Morrigan, into a deep obsession. For her, he would give it all, for he believes it is what she wants, and deserves.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic: Basic**

With his focus on studies, Oliver had shied away from delving very far into the Language of Magic. He had never been a born fighter, and lacked the motivation to make the most of his studious mind. Nevertheless, he has learned the basics of the Language of Magic, enough to apply it in everyday life, and with his own brand of ingenuity has been able to incorporate it for further conveniences. However, it is far from combat-ready, and Oliver himself has little interest in applying it for such.

**Hundredth-Heaven Martial Blade Art: Basic**

More for purposes of self defense (and venting), Oliver did take up the traditional swordfighting style of Sky Mother's Domain. Training under the martial commander Lao Sheng, he learned all the required basics of the combat style, but tuned it towards his own desired weapon of choice; while most soldiers used short swords, Oliver took up a bastard sword, and stubbornly clung onto practicing with it, such that even his notoriously cantankerous mentor was forced to defer to his request. For what purposes Oliver would use this unusually heavy sword for is somewhat apparent; "It reminds me of myself.", or so he would say. 

**Political Genius**

Oliver's primary focus in life above all, was to study the ways of the spoken word. Everything from public speaking, psychology, and politics had been consumed and read in his feverish devotion to this branch of studies. Perhaps as a way to prove himself to his family that he shouldn't have been discredited, he threw himself wholeheartedly into the science of the mind, becoming a master of manipulation in the process.
