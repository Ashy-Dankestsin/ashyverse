>*Wasting away my life? Wahaha! That's a rough way to put it. Can't say you're wrong, but I also can't say I care. I'm too old to bother with consequences anymore.*

#### Personality and History
Once the captain of Old Altum's 3rd Naval Company, the distinguished seafarer Forneus was framed when the Elder King vanished, and he and his company were wiped out in an ensuing battle. Believed to be dead, the Seafolk had survived and dragged himself to shore, where he would lay in hiding to recover, plotting his vengeance. Abandoning his name, he became a reclusive hermit, eventually finding his way to Sky Mother's Domain, where he would encounter a young Volken girl. From here, he would be dubbed a new name: Ishmael.

Despite his brutal history, Ishmael comes off as a very jovial and laid-back individual. A particular fan of bad jokes, he describes himself as "simply too old to care much", and makes no effort in presenting himself the way he had as a young and vicious captain. Always a friend to those around him, he can be described as everyone's favorite uncle. Though his sense of nobility has long vanished, his booming voice and large frame makes him a rather easy person to notice. Even so, he retains his sense of honor, and never leaves promises unchecked. Indeed, it seems like the only thing he ever takes seriously.

To one as old as him, it is rare to put more effort than needed in most situations. Particularly in casual fights, he hardly places much effort behind his swings, although his decades of experience still lends to incredibly fearsome strikes. He is also a massive fan of beer and alcohol, never passing up a chance to hit up a nearby bar to sample their cuisine. Though his tolerance is high, it's still always a good time for ol' Ishmael, and he's a notably fast friend-maker on these booze trips.

An afficionado on history, his long years have given Ishmael deep insight into historic events of the past, and when he's not stuck in a drunken stupor, his trips to town will always be spent the most on hearing local folk legends and stories, with a particular focus on oceanic myths. It is evident if you look hard enough he's looking for something from these many stories, but what it is, he won't tell, flaking off remarks as casually as he receives them.

Beneath this facade, however, lies a beast far more complex than the man himself would ever admit. Steeped in memories of a glorious past forgotten, Ishmael has been plotting vengeance against those who wronged him since the day he dredged his broken body ashore. Meticulous and calculating, this malevolent avenger is perhaps the last part of the once-bloodthirsty captain of Old Altum that still remains, a phantom that Ishmael refuses to throw away. Though his jovial outward self is far from a lie, so too does it hide this untold truth. Until the day he has his revenge, perhaps he will never be truly whole.

#### Skills
**Arham Volum: Nautilus**
A branch of the ancient Seafolk magic known as Arham Volum, translated roughly to Blackened Seas, Ishmael is a master of the Nautilus stance, focused on using the Black Sea's low density as a shield and barrier against attacks. Utilizing sheer torrential force and high-power currents, he can redirect and defend effectively against attacks of any magnitude, and with his mastery can even fully deflect magical attacks. 
Ishmael is a seasoned frontliner with this technique, but with his mastery comes another aspect, and that is his manipulation of the stance into offense. By reforming the high-intensity water currents he creates, Ishmael can create swirling maelstroms that easily ensnare foes, or summon torrential waters in a tidal wave of force. Using Invocational properties, he is also able to enchant his weapon with similar effect, creating a chainsaw-like whirlpool about his blade that can deflect physical attacks and shred bones all the same.

**Enhanced Physical Stats**
Owing to his Seafolk lineage, Ishmael possesses incredibly high strength, making him capable of such feats as shattering rocks with his bare hands, as well as swinging around his mighty and massive hunting sword with ease and precision. Combined with his training as a soldier, and the fact that he was recognized as one of Old Altum's finest, it is easy to assume Ishmael is one of the group's strongest fighters. 
Beyond his physical strength, Ishmael also boasts superhuman endurance and bulk. A natural-born tank, he can take blow after blow without so much as a flinch, his thick skin providing him with high resistance to blunt attacks. He is, however, more susceptible to sharp attacks, although even these don't seem to phase him much.
Due to his large frame and muscle mass, however, Ishmael has traded off a core physical trait: speed. Although he can react and attack quickly, his focus has certainly been on bulk over blitz, and foes focused more on quick strikes may overwhelm him.

**Seafaring Knowledge**
As a skilled sailor and former captain, Ishmael possesses strong knowledge of seafaring, from fundamentals to advanced and often important details. Adding to his Seafolk heritage, giving him intimate knowledge of undersea terrain and currents, and Ishmael easily charges to the front as an invaluable companion to have when sailing the high seas.

### Armaments & Equipment

**Worn Anchor**
A curious and unorthodox weapon, this heavy Blacksteel anchor is characteristic of an ancient kingdom's great naval warships, ones that would've been at their prime during Ishmael's younger years. Though not built for combat, it has high durability owing to its original purpose, and serves as a strong blunt weapon when wielded with Ishmael's incredible strength. According to Ishmael himself, this particularly anchor seems to have been owned by 'an old friend' before he inherited it, although he does not elaborate much on this past.
