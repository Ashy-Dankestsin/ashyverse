#### Personality and History
Only daughter of the legendary Zephyrspine Knight, and subsequently pampered beyond belief by said knight, Donna was gifted the title of Knight Lord through a loophole her father exploited to induct her officially without requiring due notice. This has made her, historically, the youngest to ever take the title of Knight Lord, ascending to the position when she was only 12. However, due to her inexperience and clear fact that she is a child, her duties have been reduced significantly, which has left Donna a little sour that she was both forced to take the seat yet isn't given the same due respect.

Young and spry, Donna is more than a little bit spoilt; having been tended to for her every whim by her doting parents, she has grown up to be somewhat of a troublemaker, developing a rather problematic stubbornness streak when things don't go her way. She is quick to anger, more than a little prickly, and has a tendency to start kicking and yelling to win arguments, although these habits have been somewhat curbed by her tutelage under Kaiser.

Though she is more than just a handful, Donna is a strangely competent young child. She is versed in political logistics, and has some degree of authority within the ranks of Willowshire's knights, owing to her father's illustrious career. She is more than willing to utilize said authority to properly tackle issues, and does so quite well, although she does also abuse her lineage for, say, discounted ice cream.

Though having been something of an unwilling participant in her father's plan to give her a seat amongst the knights, Donna still holds him, and the Knight Lord title, to high regard. She puts her best to ensuring her family's name is not smeared, and works harder than most to convince herself and those around her that she does deserve this title. Following in Kaiser's footsteps, Donna's originally neutral view on Knighthood has since become similar to her mentor's; in her eyes, knights were most gallant when they had something to protect, something to serve. Though not as intense in her beliefs as Grandpa Kaiser, she still sees Knighthood as a duty to serve, over any individual freedom.

#### Skills
**Zephyrspine Combat Arts**
Trained under the unique school of combat her own father developed in his 30 years of service as a Knight Lord, Donna fights using a massively long spear that she manipulates as if it were part of her own body. A combination of spinning strikes, thrusts, and unpredictable movement lends to this school of combat a uniquely dizzying style. The core of this method, however, is the use of the spear as a form of movement. By using it as a vaulting pole, combined with her own light weight thanks to Aves lineage, Donna is able to skillfully vault and hop over and around foes, striking them at the same time in a swift and precise flurry of attacks.

**Embodiment of Acceleration**
Considered one of Great Willowshire's strongest Embodiments to date, the only limiting factor of this ability is Donna's own inexperience using it. Freeform manipulation of her own acceleration grants her the incredible ability to heighten her speed to ludicrous levels, and at her current limit she is capable of launching herself at speeds that shatter the sound barrier, piercing through enemy lines like a ballistic arrow. This ability is her title's namesake, the titular Thunderclap that is heard whenever she launches herself. However, due to her own sensitive hearing, she's not much a fan of doing so. Even so, the ability to rapidly increase the speed of herself and her spear gives her unmatched maneuverability along the battlefield.

**Mount Riding and Combat**
As a young girl (not that she isn't still), Donna would travel to Tempestward and experience for the first time the joy of horseback riding. Since then, she has grown an obsession with riding on great beasts for both personal enjoyment and for use in battle. Trained in mounted combat, Donna is able to ride just about any of Willowshire's indigenous mount animals, including horses, ankylosaurs, and great hares. However, her favorite mount for standard combat is her own Patron Faerie, Arbalyst. Assuming the form of a horse with a ballista for its head, it is completely in tune with Donna, and together the two form a very destructive combo.
