#### Personality and History
Eldest daughter of former Knight Lord The Windrider Knight, Hannah Anil Celestine was born with the expectations that she would take the seat of her mother as Knight Lord when the time came. Although she inherited the talent (and height) of her retiring mother, Hannah herself absolutely lacked the confidence and drive that had been present in the Knight Lords before her, and tried desperately to nominate her younger brother to the position instead. Ultimately, however, her talents were simply too strong to ignore, and she was eventually inducted after some peaceful coercion.

Hannah's daunting height belies her timid and demure personality. A coward by heart with a massive aversion to conflict, she struggles a lot to deal with the expectations that have been shouldered onto her ever since her induction. She frequently bursts into minor panic attacks every time adversity makes itself known, and abuses her fleetfooted genes to make quick getaways whenever the need arises. Hannah is, by all means, not a good Knight Lord, and she herself is more than aware.

Whenever she is not panicking, however, Hannah is a conserved but otherwise friendly individual. Even though she lacks the logistical know-how of fellow Knight Lords, she makes up for it by being a more active member of the community than most, organizing small events and helping anyone she comes across on the streets. From youth, she had been putting her tall frame to use, and even now continues to do so. Despite her insistence on not becoming a Knight Lord, Hannah is proud to bear the title, and proud of her family lineage. Most of her anxieties come from a place of wanting to do good by her family name, in the end.

For Hannah, Knighthood has never held any special meaning. It does not entail any specific personal rule, nor does it invoke any particular grudges or frustrations. Knighthood is simply a job, and a duty to fulfill. She holds no opinions on one side or another, and has remained mostly neutral during inter-council debates. However, she does understand one thing; whichever side comes out on top, the priority will always be the people.

#### Skills
**Ironfist Combat: Kicking Style**
Trained in the martial arts of the Order of the Ironfist, Hannah put to use her long legs and has trained exclusively in the art of combat through kicking. Equipped with lightweight and durable greaves, she can deliver devastatingly powerful strikes with her legs, capable of shattering stone and even denting metal. Combined with her already strong legs owing to her lineage, and the force of Hannah's kicks on the battlefield have been said to even be capable of piercing through a human body. The woman herself, however, has never performed such a grisly act. She'd probably cry.

**Language of Magic: Wind**
Hannah was taught this specific brand of Wind Evocation from a young age by her mother, a technique she had developed to earn her keep as the Windrider Knight. Through a specific form of chanting, Hannah is able to create invisible "platforms" in the air by compressing wind down until it becomes near-tangible, and then coating her own legs in a layer of swirling wind. The contact between the platform and the coating generates an updraft, which Hannah is able to then ride and continuously perform until she simulates flight. Hannah, however, has yet to fully master this technique, in part due to her debilitating phobia of heights making her incapable of actually "riding" the wind into the sky.
Beyond this rather unique application, the simple act of Evoking swirling wind around her legs gives her powerful kicks an even stronger force, functionally generating small vortexes of wind that shred through armor on contact.

**Enhanced Leg Strength**
A genetic disposition for all Kharavya, Hannah possesses above-average leg strength, granting her faster and stronger strides, a capacity to jump great heights, and overall increased stamina with her legs. With her vigorous training, she possesses very strong and flexible legs.
