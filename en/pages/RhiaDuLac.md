#### Personality and History
The current representative of the prestigious House Du Lac, and the leader of the Silver Lily faction of Great Willowshire, Rhia Du Lac has earned great renown for her work as a Knight Lord since her induction 11 years ago. A picture portrait of a perfect knight, she is the idol of many a young squire, her stature made even more prestigious by its connection; she is the latest in a long lineage dating back to the Founding Knight Lancelot himself.

Charismatic, outgoing, and all around friendly, Rhia charms all she comes across with her looks and personality. As if a prince charming manifested from a picture book, she seemingly excels in anything she does, be it dance, combat, literature, and all manner of the arts. Her one weakness seems to be severe tone-deafness when it comes to singing, not that she'd ever tell anyone.

Aside from her personal skills, Rhia is also a stalwart and effective leader, her natural charisma combining with solid tactical acumen to create a daunting force in any group battle. Those who serve under her faction hold a great deal of respect for her skills. Her combat style has been likened to an elegant dance, a true display of mastery over her chosen weapon, the rapier.

Rhia holds deep faith in her personal beliefs on Knighthood, that being freedom. To her, a knight is one who is free, bearing no one's whims but their own, and capable of going anywhere they wish. It is for this reason she holds a hidden contempt for her ancestor's binding Oath to the One True King, and the nation's inability to move forward from that ancient promise. In her opinion, and those of her knights, the oath should be abolished, and the nation once again become a free land for its people to travel as they please. However, her inexperience in actual civil management and overall naivete in the world due to her sheltered upbringing have led to criticisms of her wish being far too idealistic.

#### Skills
**Du Lac Swordsmanship: Mastery**
As expected of the Founding Knight's latest descendant, Rhia has trained tirelessly to live up to the expectations that her lineage brings, and she has indeed done so flawlessly. A true master of the Du Lac school of swordfighting, her elegance and grace upon the battlefield is only matched by the ferocity and speed of her attacks. Specialized in fast thrusts and precise strikes, Rhia's skills let her dispatch of enemies with incredible ease, without ever missing a beat.

Beyond just combat purposes, Rhia has mastered the arts of anti-combat swordplay as well, being capable of clashing so violently with opposing weapons that she can stagger enemies incredibly well. This, however, is not her usual form of combat.

**Language of Magic: Water**
Though expected of those who practice Du Lac Swordsmanship, the strength of Rhia's water-based magics are still a sight to behold. Coating her rapier in torrential waves through Invocation, it is not unlike the ingenuity of the Seafolk to transform one's weapon into a raging sea storm. Along with this, she also has great talent in Evocation, conjuring great tidal waves that she surfs upon in combat, enveloping enemies and disorienting entire platoons with the surge of water. This skill in particular is what has earned her the title of "The Wavebreaker Knight".
