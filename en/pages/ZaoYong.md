#### Personality and History
Hailing from the Lowlands, Zao Yong was born to a humble family and a humble life, but was gifted with extraordinary strength and intelligence from a young age. With his natural talents and dedication, he quickly became a star citizen of the Lowlands, and his talents would ultimately be recognized by the heads of state. Zhao Yong from then on would be granted title of Minister of Lowland Affairs. 

A natural-born pacifist and overall nice person, Zao Yong possesses a strong sense of justice, and always strives to do the good thing. He longs for unified peace, and understands intimately the struggles of the people around him. Always empathetic and willing to lend a hand, he is favored by all who meet him, a rare case of a politician who only wants to do good, yet Zao Yong has never let that favor get the better of him.

Zao Yong commands an imposing aura due to his size, and even more so because of his strength of will. Idealistic to a fault, he truly believes in a pacifistic and just cause, for better and for worse. Unyielding and uncompromising, he will push himself to his limits to support his dreams, a passion that extends to most of his supporters and subordinates. On his off days, however, he simply enjoys taking in the fresh air of his home, never one to abandon his roots.

When the civil war of Sky Mother's Domain broke out, Zao Yong took command of his subordinates and retreated to the Lowlands in order to ensure the safety of his people. From there, he formed a faction known as the Will of the Lowlands, embodying the dream and desire of the Lowlanders to form an individual state and fully separate from the Highlands as its own entity. Accompanied by his many supporters, his faction is the smallest, but also the most dedicated, and Zao Yong himself will spare no expense to settle things as peacefully as he can.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic: Basics**

Hardly one for combat or magic, Zao Yong has little skill outside of simple domestic usage of the Language of Magic. He can conjure water to wash dishes, or use fire to heat up a kettle, but beyond that is too much. However, he has at least studied on the Language itself to a fairly deep level, and is capable of advising on its usage, if nothing else.

**Enhanced Strength and Endurance**

Zao Yong was born with an unnaturally sturdy build, and as he grew older, he continued to grow larger in size until around 23 years old, where he would peak at his current height of 240cm. His muscle mass is not to be underestimated; despite minimal training, he retains an incredible amount of physical endurance and strength, capable of shrugging off even blades with ease. However, his pacifistic nature has made him avoid training in any form of notable combat, and as such lacks experience in actual combat.

**Political Expertise**

A studious and intelligent man, Zao Yong possesses deep knowledge of his nation's inner workings, as well as politics in general. He is considered one of the smartest ministers in office at the moment.
