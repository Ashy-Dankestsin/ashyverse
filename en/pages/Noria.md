#### Personality and History
A young girl raised in the Deepwoods of Great Willowshire. Birthplace and parentage unknown, her earliest memories were at the side of her mentor, a mysterious woman whose identity not even Noria seems to know. Having vanished and left behind a mysterious guidebook over 7 years ago, Noria sets out on a journey following in her mentor's notes to see the world.

Noria is an incredibly optimistic girl. With a goofy smile for every occasion, she is a bouncing ball of sunshine who always tries her best. Inspired by legendary heroes from the stories of her beloved mentor, Noria will never ignore a person in need, reaching out a helping hand no matter what manner of foe she faces. She believes in the inherent goodness of everyone, and though it doesn't always pan out well, she'll always get back up and keep moving forward.

Due to her confined upbringing and low exposure to the outside world, Noria is absolutely inexperienced with modern society. This inexperience fuels her endless curiosity about the world, and she'll always look to try new things. Noria makes it a habit to take in every smell, taste, sight, sound and touch she can find. This may be why she has horrible management of funds...!

As of now, most of her favorites have been new foodstuffs to dig into. She's something of a foodie.

Though not a born extrovert, Noria strives to interact as much as possible with those around her, perhaps as an extension of her natural curiosity. Regardless, her lack of contact with actual people for the majority of her life leaves her somewhat inexperienced at striking conversations, and she will often flub or make mistakes in her words and exact meanings. Although the embarrassment doesn't bother her much, it may leave passerbys a bit concerned about her.

Despite this lack of street-smarts, Noria possesses an outstanding level of historical and literature-related knowledge, particularly pertaining to the legends and history of the continent of Atheria. Capable of reciting the names of most major and minor facets of history, she both amazes and confuses listeners with intrinsic knowledge of events that are neither recorded in historical documents nor should be known to anyone who wasn't directly there to witness it. All in all, this makes her appear to be far more literate about the world than she actually is, as most of her knowledge, grandiose as it is, appears to be dated at least a hundred years from the modern day, leaving Noria nevertheless confused by modern evolution. She also has a bad habit of running her mouth too much on these topics.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic Mastery**
Noria is incredibly well-versed in the Language of Magic. From intonations to grammar, she is able to recite from heart the intricacies of the language, and apply them masterfully to her everyday life. Though she carries no inherent specialties, unlike most who practice magic verses, Noria is instead able to use almost any words or verses taught to her, making her a powerful Jack-of-all-Trades. 


**Analytic (Language of Magic)**
Though slow and airheaded in almost any other situation, Noria possesses an incredible talent for deciphering and decoding spoken magic verses on the fly. This skill makes her a major threat in any magic fight, as simply through a few interactions, she is able to quickly decipher and counter most forms of magic thrown her way. Additionally, this talent allows for her to very quickly grasp new words she may not have known. It is no understatement to say that Noria may well be a Master in the art of analyzing the Language of Magic.

**Athletic**
Due to her years of leaping, running, and hunting through the Deepwoods of Great Willowshire, Noria has developed a rather impressive physique, capable of withstanding a decent amount of strenuous activity. She is also shockingly nimble, able to clear long distances in single sprints or leaps.
