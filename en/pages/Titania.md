#### Personality and History
Born only a few decades after the Great Faeries of the Lake and the Deepwoods, Titania commands absolute authority over every Faerie in existence due to her True Name aligning with the concept of Faeries. Having worked alongside her sisters to create the foundations of Great Willowshire, she now spends her time travelling the world, shirking her duties in favor of hedonistic indulgence, and nobody can stop her.

Wild, carefree and unchained, Titania is a hedonistic Faerie with a long streak of partying, debauchery, and general lack of restraint. For the better part of her centuries lived, she has spent them doing whatever she felt like, throwing any and all responsibility to her kind and her domain to Nimue to handle. In her own words, it's better that someone who knows what she's doing handles all that, admitting that she has little vested interest in actually "being" a queen.

However, she also enjoys flaunting and abusing her authority as Queen of Faeries, often taunting and demeaning those around her as inferior. Her prideful attitude extends to basically anyone in the world, save for her fellow Great Faeries, who she regards as sisters. Even then, she only ever defers to the eldest, Nimue. A troublemaker through and through, Titania has often been cited as incredibly difficult, rude, and overall a horrible person to be around.

Titania does still have a few redeeming qualities, ultimately. Despite her rude exterior, she is fiercely protective of those she cares about, and is a known romantic. Even now, she still dreams of the white knight to sweep her off her feet. On the rare occasions she settles down, as well, she shows herself to be quite insightful, her travels giving her strong knowledge of affairs outside her homeland.

Underneath those layers, however, lies a truth about Titania's personality. A deeply harmed soul. the loss of someone dear to her to an incident she perceived as avoidable has festered inside for centuries. Her hedonism and desire to travel stems from a hidden disdain for her homeland, as if it had betrayed her when it stole that person away, a feeling she neither wants nor dislikes. She has yet to come to terms with it, but even she knows it will eventually grow too big to ignore. Still, she cannot abandon it.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic - Earth**

Unlike the rest of her kin, Titania was not born into a specific natural aspect, object type, or even animal name. As such, her Language of Magic skills were cultivated naturally, albeit with some benefits of being able to speak it to a degree. In Titania's case, her specialization was in the manipulation of the land underfoot. Despite not being innate, her skill with this form of Magecraft is still impressive; the ability to shift even the landmasses of Great Willowshire, one used extensively to terraform the nation into what it is today.

**Embodiment of Faeries**

What Titania truly is, however, is the very concept of Faeriehood itself. Of the 3 Great Faeries, she is the the youngest, but the existence of Faeries themselves stems from her birth. As the very essence of this concept, Titania possesses absolute authority over any and all Faeries born after her. For the strongest ones, this means they are incapable of striking her, and are mentally inclined to kneel before her presence. For the weakest, it is total subjugation of the mind in her presence. For Titania to speak a command is to will an unbending law within all Faeries' minds, regardless of what the law entails. The only Faeries this cannot apply to are Nimue and Carissa; the reasonings are not entirely clear, but it is likely a result of their birth being before Titania's.
