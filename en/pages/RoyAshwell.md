#### Personality and History
Born to a small-town writer and seamstress, Roy is a young man hailing from the southern rural township of Faery Grove in Great Willowshire. His childhood was that of a normal Willowian child, but tragedy would strike in his teenage years when his father was called to arms once more, and perished on an ill-fated expedition. Though Roy denies it, he was never quite able to move on, but retained a fairly normal life into the current day. Roy's reality, however, was never quite normal even before then, for he was born to be the country's fated One True King.

Having lived a normal life, Roy is in all manners unremarkable from the outset. Outspoken and extroverted, he carries himself with a twinge of sarcasm and sass in every word, and a constant smirk across his face. Though he may appear standoffish at times, it is simply his nature. Roy, at heart, is a caring and kind man, always courteous to everyone around him, and never skipping a beat to give a friendly compliment. This, however, usually only serves to make him more punchable.

His extroverted personality means Roy has no problems striking up conversations and making friends in any scenario, which he will often use to his advantage when the situation calls for it. Naturally charismatic, he describes himself with "devlishly good looks", much to his fellows' chagrin, though there is no understating Roy's natural charm in conversation.

Roy is an advocate of personal freedom, above all else. Although his laid-back and freeflowing demeanor makes him seem uncaring, he harbors deep repressed feelings about his stance in the world, given his destiny. Although he understands the weight he bears, he ignores it all the same, having hidden his true identity from the country for his whole life. In Roy's eyes, to become the One True King would only serve to shirk his own freedom, though to say he holds no second thoughts on the matter would be lying.

Raised in the culture of Great Willowshire, Roy is deeply respectful of his family. Having descended from a former Retainer House, he wears his lineage and their many accomplishments with pride, but he will often clash with himself over his own decisions. Roy sees his selfishness as both his strength and weakness, a disappointment to his heritage; his stubborn refusal to answer the call of destiny born from watching his own father die to such a fate.

#### Skills
**Du Lac Swordsmanship: Anti-Combat Arts**

As per the standard curriculum of any young adult in Great Willowshire, Roy has been trained in the nation's unique Du Lac Swordsmanship. Granted a vial of enchanted water, Roy is capable of manifesting water-based slashing attacks in combat, used in conjunction with sword training. Roy himself dropped out fairly early into his training, but still possesses an intermediate level of swordfighting, his personal focus having been in pacifistic disarming techniques. 

**Language of Magic: Fire**

Roy is not well-learned on much of the Language of Magic, only knowing key terms taught under Great Willowshire. He is, however, decently skilled in his own family's specialty, that being Fire-based Invocations. Infusing his weapons and the surrounding air with fire, Roy brandishes his flames in combat, often used as a deterrent, even being capable of heating up enemy weapon hilts to disarm them.

Though he specializes in Invocation, Roy is also able to Evoke fire, albeit at a lesser degree than through Invocation. 

**Domestic Skills**

Roy has an exceptional repertoire of domestic skills and talents, ranging from efficient laundry to incredible cooking. His experience living alone has created a man capable of handling any domestic affair in a household with lightning-fast speed, both inside or out of the house. He himself does not seem shy about his talents, and embraces them with all the smugness and haughtiness of a pampered cat. No one can refute his talents, though.
