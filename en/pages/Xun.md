#### Personality and History
High Priest of the Tianmu Royal Council, and the one known as "The Closest to Heaven". Xun has served the Royal Council for decades, owing a life debt to the Sky Mother when she saved him from certain death during a religious pilgrimage. Ever since, he has dedicated himself to perfecting her nation, believing himself the sole steward to her will, ignoring the cries of ones he deems inferior to himself. In her absence, he has ascended to even greater power, yet for all his goals, ruling the nation of his goddess is hardly what he desires.

A cunning and ambitious man, Xun has staked his claim within Sky Mother's Domain, embodying both the power and unyielding rule of the nation's foundation. Acutely aware of all things political that occur within the domain, he is swift and relentless in his pursuit of absolute glory, weeding out ne'er-do-wells across the Highlands. In his eyes, only the greatest is deserving to be presented to the Sky Mother, after all.

This, however, has caused Xun to grow resentful of people he deems "unworthy". In his eyes, the mighty Lung are the truest embodiments of godhood, inspired by the Sky Mother's serpentine form. As such, Xun despises those who would tarnish her radiance, in his eyes. He has a particular fixation on those of the Kadali race; the most paltry imitations of the glorious dragons. The reasons for this are difficult to say, though his own lineage being of the Kadali may shed light on that factor, somewhat.

To Xun, only the Sky Mother may rule her domain. When the civil war broke out in her absence, Xun's resentment for the "tainted" lineage of her most recent descendants only grew further, not to mention his disdain for those of the Lowlands. Leading a faction comprised mainly of the upper echelons of the Ministry, Xun holds that no one but the goddess herself has a right to the throne, and in her absence he must act as steward of the throne, ensuring none but she may sit upon it. To his allies and enemies alike, he may appear to be a usurper, claiming the throne in her absence behind a veil of lies. Yet, his standing in this war may well be the only thing he has ever been truthful about.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic: Wind**

Though he rarely uses it these days, Xun studied a branch of Wind-based Magecraft in his youth, and used it liberally for self-defense during his long religious pilgrimage from his homeland. Since his arrival and employment in Sky Mother's Domain, he has since abandoned the use of Magecraft due to lack of necessity, though his strength in it is still not to be underestimated.

**Political Expertise**

With intellect, cunning and ambition to back it up, Xun is a powerful force within the Ministry, bolstering support for his stances with charisma like none other. Though he lacks respect to those in the same line of business as him, it cannot be understated how beneficial his rules have been to the country's prosperity.
