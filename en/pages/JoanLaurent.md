#### Personality and History
The youngest daughter of the prestigious House Laurent, Joan is the youngest among 5 sisters, all of whom showed prodigious talent in the Language of Magic, as was customary of her house's lineage. It was expected she would follow in their footsteps, until it became apparent Joan was one of few in the world incapable of harnessing the Language of Magic at all. Despite this setback, she insisted on continuing her knight training, but quickly fell short of expectations due to this affliction. Nevertheless, her tenacity would pay off, and she would come under the wing of a Senior Knight who shared her sentiments, Rogier.

A ball of self-assured sunshine, Joan has never let her affliction get the better of her, and takes both it and all the challenges of life in stride. Never one to give up, her mental fortitude to have endured for so long can only be called remarkable, and combined with unrivalled tenacity in reaching her goals makes Joan a force to be reckoned with, at least mentally. 

Despite her noble blood, she far prefers spending time in the wilderness, sprinting across large plain expanses and soaking in the warmth of the world. She has well adopted her teacher's idealogies of Knighthood as freedom, and fully embodies that ideal as she moves forward in life, determined to keep it close in her heart always.

Though far from completely inept, Joan is nonetheless something of a musclehead. With more brawn than brains, she struggles to parse more complex academic topics or even basic problem-solving, assuring herself that even if all else fails, a good kick won't. As far as she's concerned, nothing can't be solved by running into it at higher speeds, much to the chagrin of her teacher. Always eager but never thinking, Joan is a girl who puts her foot forward first before asking about consequences.

#### Skills
**Freewheel Combat**
Under the tutalage of Rogier of Ulri, Joan's training as a squire has been far from the ordinary knight, but she loves it nonetheless. Taught in all manners of tricky swordfighting, her unbridled enthusiasm and unyielding tenacity has allowed her to very quickly adopt this very loose and improvisation-heavy style of combat. For someone like her, it might even be preferred. Though she has yet to master the dual sword-wielding of her mentor, Joan has managed to incorporate her incredible leg strength, alongside her speed and dodging prowess, to create an unorthodox yet powerful form of combat.

**Enhanced Physical Prowess**
Owing to her Chevalier blood, as well as her own training and penchant for running across open fields, Joan possesses an incredibly high amount of stamina. Capable of sprinting consistently over brutally long distances, her favorite pasttime has granted her nearly unlimited stamina, alongside heightened endurance thanks to her training. In particular, her legs have grown quite powerful, and can deliver frighteningly strong kicks. If only they had better reach...
