#### Personality and History
The young princess of Sky Mother's Domain. Eldest daughter of the late queen, and current-in-line to ascend the throne, Yong Wen has been made to shoulder the burden of expectation from her nation, a feeling she struggles with but continues to persevere through. When the Tianmu Civil War broke out, she assumed control of a faction of loyalists known as the Spring Wind, united by a lofty desire to see Yong Wen's rule come to pass, and for an absolute unity of the Sky Mother's people in the heavens above.

Quiet and reserved, she is often described as a river lily, dainty yet firm. Despite her short stature, she commands a strong presence as princess, and is treated with great respect from citizens and ministers alike. Her resolve to do good by her mother's name is second to none, and she strives to be a model citizen that everyone can look up to.

However, Yong Wen hides beneath her quiet disposition anxieties and insecurities that she is still unable to shake. Her own naivete and lack of experience has caused many issues in the past, and despite the reassurances of those around her, she continues to struggle to find her place even as a queen-to-be. Her own introverted nature prevents her from seeking help, however. In her heart, she believes her responsibility to her nation equates to bearing the entire nation's burden unto herself, and as such presents herself as somewhat self-sacrificial, willing to stake far too much on her frail body to handle.

A known lover of peace, her approach to politics has always been about pacifism and settling differences. Regardless of her physical fortitude, Yong Wen possesses a sound mind and strong aptitude for speaking, as well as an unrivalled determination to her own dreams. To most, she is the gentle yet distant princess. To those closest to her, she is the sweet and reserved Lung, Yong Wen. She is also aggressively gay, but she hasn't yet let people in on that.

As daughter to the former Queen, Yong Wen had been raised in luxury, residing in the Highlands and being allowed to indulge in all it had to offer. For years, she gazed down on the Lowlands, and though she never held contempt for the common man, neither did she relate to their lived experiences. Her opinion, shared with the rest of her group, was that the people of the Lowlands deserved to also indulge upon the Highlands' offerings. Though her ideals were well-meaning, she ultimately never consulted with the people she seemed to subconsciously pity, her own experiences belying a lack of knowledge of what exactly the people wanted.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic: Wind**

Compared to her younger brother, who favored martial arts over Magecraft, Yong Wen has specialized herself as a powerful user of wind-based Magecraft. Capable of whipping up powerful whirlwinds and blistering surges of razor-sharp wind, her competence and skill have come from training since youth alongside Fuyun. Her Magecraft is known to leak through her emotions, as well; despite her often deadpan expression, she may sometimes create gusts of wind subconsciously if she's bothered.

**Thousandth-Heaven Martial Blade Art: Basic**

Per royal curriculum of Sky Mother's Domain, Yong Wen was also requested to take up arms in one of the nation's 3 primary martial boundaries. In her case, she decided to take up the Boundary of the Blade, trained in sword-fighting and swift and efficient movement. Having mastered the Hundredth-Heaven Martial Blade Art, she is considered a trainee in the 2nd phase art of the Boundary of the Blade, the Thousandth-Heaven Martial Blade Art. Like all practitioners of the art, Yong Wen is specialized in sword-based combat, and she is a master of abusing her magical prowess in tandem with her swordsmanship to create a versatile, speedy, and disorienting combat style.

**Lineage of the Sky Mother: Transcendence**

As with all descendants who possess the blood of the Sky Mother, Yong Wen is capable of calling upon her primal ancestry and transform into a massive dragon. In this form, she appears as a massive serpentine dragon, with a wider upper torso and large arms. Her scales are iridescent pink, and she is capable of spewing enormously powerful bursts of wind from her mouth. Her Ancestral Gem, the keystone of this transformation, is split into 8 shining pearls that swirl around her neck constantly.
