#### Personality and History
A somewhat mysterious figure within the ranks of Great Willowshire's Senior Knights. Hailing from the distant land of Ulri, Rogier came to Great Willowshire as a child many years ago, and quickly proved his mettle as a mighty knight and combatant. For a period of time, he was among the youngest to have held the title of Knight Lord. However, an incident during his brief tenure would push him away from this title, eventually revoking it entirely and disappearing from the public eye.

A calm and collected man, Rogier has chosen to take life at a slow and comfortable pace. Long burnt out on the politics of his nation, he seems to never have a worry on his mind, and spends much of his time on menial chores and small hobbies. Though still young in the eyes of many, he has nevertheless gained much wisdom in his time, which he never hesitates to impart onto those younger than him. 

Thanks to his laid-back attitude, very few hold him in much high regard, seeing it as a sign of laziness, or perhaps demotivation. Rogier thinks very little of these things; really, he doesn't think about them at all. A proponent of "Knighthood is freedom", his carefree attitude is just his own way of following his idealogy, and one he holds in high regard. 

Despite this, he is still capable of doing good work when required. In particular, he seems to have a talent for teaching, and several young knights who have been tutored under him speak nothing but praise for his effective methods. Indeed, Rogier himself has a small passion for training new squires in the field, seeing it as the best way to pass his legacy onto the next generation. As of now, he is the acting mentor to the young squire Joan Laurent, who he treats almost as a little sister.

One strange facet of Rogier is his personal creed to never use the Language of Magic. It is unknown what ocurred in his past to spur such a strange personal rule, but it is one of few things he seems sorely adamant about, despite his own personal talent at the craft.

#### Skills
**Freewheel Combat**
Having followed Great Willowshire's standard curriculum, Rogier is a skilled swordsman, focusing primarily on dual rapiers. However, despite graduating with top honours, those skills have little to do with how the man actually fights. A freewheeling style that follows no school of combat, Rogier can best be described as "unpredictable", using incredible tactical acumen and reaction speed to disorient and confuse foes. With a plethora of weapons both held and hidden, sleights-of-hand that could astonish even trained magicians, and a lack of any magic to his combat style, Rogier is a formidable foe with perhaps Willowshire's most unorthodox form of fighting.

**Domestic Skills**
With all his years spent in Great Willowshire on his own, Rogier has many domestic skills at his disposal which he uses for both convenience, and a handy extra lesson to any squires that come under his guidance.

**Language of Magic**
For all his talk about not using the Language of Magic, Rogier is nevertheless a skilled user, as is expected of a former resident of Ulri. In particular, he seems to have been trained in the Spiritcalling Arts that are standard of Ulrians, the ability to harness and infuse the spirits of the dead to assist in combat. Rogier has shown this very sparsely throughout his entire knight career, but desperate times have forced his hand once or twice on certain expeditions in the past. For the few who caught a glimpse of it, there has only ever been one word they've used to describe Rogier's magic: Eerie.
