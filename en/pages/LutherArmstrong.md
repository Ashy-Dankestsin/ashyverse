#### Personality and History
Hailing from a nomadic tribe from the far south of Great Willowshire, Luther Armstrong arrived to the land of knights with their family as part of a traditional nomadic trek across ancestral lands. However, they soon proved themselves for the title of Knight Lord after besting the previous seated Grovetender Knight in a one-on-one duel, the former Knight Lord's personal criteria for appointing a successor. With a crushing victory, Luther gained immediate renown amongst their peers, and after a brief training period with the Order of the Ironfist, was officially inducted in only a year.

Loud and boisterous, Luther possesses a large frame and larger personality, befitting someone who spent their youth trekking across wild mountains with reckless abandon. Their presence is felt in any situation, a constant thunderous voice echoing across even the noisiest pubs. In short, a jock. A big fan of the outdoors as well, Luther took the role of Campaign Knight mainly so they could continue to enjoy their nomadic and free-spirited lifestyle despite their newfound responsibilities.

Luther is a musclehead through and through. With little regard for personal safety or responsibility, they are more than willing to throw themselves into any brawl on the street, minor or major. To them, life is all about brawling, and they seem to view it as naturally as breathing. It is clear from their family that this trait was not inherited from any tradition, but simply an extension of Luther's own love for the art of combat. With all the fervor of a small child at a birthday party, they relish in full-force fights, and will challenge just about anyone willing to throw down.

Luther cares little for the political situations and circumstances of Great Willowshire. They hold little regard or respect for the sacred Oath to the Empty Throne, and in their opinion, the One True King should just be decided by a fistfight (this was shot down by Kaiser). To them, Knighthood is about combat; to train one's whole life, and be able to go all out at the end in a magnificent duel is what Luther believes to be the absolute goal of any knight. To that end, they are constantly testing the mettle of those around them, going as far as to challenge fellow Knight Lords on multiple occasions just for fun.

#### Skills
**Ironfist Combat: Punching Style**
With years of mountain climbing under their belt, Luther has built up massive upper body strength, and as such was recommended the lethal and brutal Punching Style of the Order of the Ironfist. With deadly accuracy and power, they are able to deliver a flurry of powerful blows that could easily splinter anyone's bones to bits. Their love of combat emboldening their might, Luther is considered one of the strongest knights to serve the Order, with brass gauntlets that further empower his fists.

**Ironfist Combat: Striker Style**
Aside from their fists, Luther has also learned to weaponize their entire arm span for combat. Under the Striker Style, they are able to use a variety of elbow and palm strikes, and even use their shoulders for devastating charging potential. It is the combination of Luther's mastery over these two schools of combat that grants them a monstrous presence on a battlefield.

**Embodiment of Shockwaves**
Born to a simple life in the mountains, Luther would quickly discover a mighty power within themselves: the power to unleash massively destructive shockwaves through striking air. Considered an Embodiment, they can manipulate these shockwaves freely to further empower their already brutal strikes, creating a technique heralded as their mightiest strike, The Mountain Splitter, a name that is quite self explanatory.
Though Luther enjoys the heightened power this trait gives them, it makes their favorite hobby of mountain climbing something of a hazard to those around him, for even a slight mistake may send an avalanche of rock and stone barreling down in all directions.
