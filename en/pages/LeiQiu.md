#### Personality and History
The prince of Sky Mother's Domain and younger brother to princess Yong Wen, Lei Qiu had always admired his father's militaristic legacy, and followed in his footsteps to try and become a great warrior, as well. However, with his sister being chosen for the throne over him, he grew bitter with his station, and elected to become King in his own way. This led to the creation of Autumnal Earth, a faction of Lei Qiu's loyalists who seek to usurp the throne for him, and to establish a new rule for Sky Mother's Domain; the abolishment of the Highlands, and the descent of the nation into the Lowlands.

Unlike his calm and introverted sister, Lei Qiu is an aggressive and passionate individual. Wearing his emotions on his sleeve at all times, he is loud and unafraid to make his opinions and stances clear, and his outgoing nature makes him well-liked by his peers and subordinates. However, he also has a very loose temper, and is known to lash out at unwitting victims for just about any inconvenience, a lack of control stemming from his internalized self-esteem issues.

Lei Qiu is also a major fan of history, particularly of famous battles and war heroes. His own father still remains today as his biggest idol, and he is able to name off the top of his head many famous tacticians, warriors, and even specific strategies, calling upon this knowledge to aid him in combat. Whether or not they actually ever work notwithstanding, Lei Qiu continues to stake his pride and life in these past legends, hoping their favor will guide him to victory.

However, due to his young age and inexperience, Lei Qiu is somewhat of a pushover when it comes to politics. His passion, though loud, does not translate well to public speech, and he tends to seize up when under pressure, uncertain of what to say in the right moment. He believes actions speak louder than words, but even with his royal blood, Lei Qiu is often looked down on or dismissed for his naivete in actual decision-making, much to his chargrin.

To Lei Qiu, who had never found much happiness in the Highlands, he saw the Lowlands as an escape. He saw the ways the people lived their lives, and longed for that carefree, everyday spirit. He wished wholeheartedly to show the people of the Highlands this life, perhaps partially as a way to show them he was capable of something. Similarly to his sister, however, for all his platitudes and genuine respect towards the Lowlands people, Lei Qiu still failed to comprehend what they truly wanted, and what the implications of bringing the Highlands down would lead to.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic: Earth**

Though he is practiced mainly in martial arts, Lei Qiu's own usage of the Language of Magic is nothing to scoff at, either. Focused primarily on earth-based techniques, he is able to manipulate the rock and dirt beneath his feet at will, creating disruptive terrain alterations that can shift the tides of battles in his favor. He is also able to Augment himself with earthen material, granting boosted durability and protection from strikes.

**Sixth Setting Sun Martial Spear Art: Mastery**

Per royal curriculum of Sky Mother's Domain, Lei Qiu has been well-trained in the Boundary of the Spear, focusing entirely on that weapon form. With diligence and hard work, he has achieved a mastery rank in the 2nd tier of the Boundary, the Sixth Setting Sun Martial Spear Art. This martial form, unlike the Sword Arts, focus on powerful thrusts and downward swings, delivering crushing damage through full-force strikes that are slow but effective. Lei Qiu brings the potential of his draconic lineage to full effect when fighting with the Spear Arts, combining that with his earthen magics to rupture entire terrains with brutal swings of his spear, a reckless fighting style that harms both allies and foes alike. Nevertheless, his own shortcomings with tactical acumen have led him to foster this fighting style as his bread and butter.

**Lineage of the Sky Mother: Transcendence**

As with all descendants who possess the blood of the Sky Mother, Lei Qiu is capable of calling upon her primal ancestry and transform into a massive dragon. In this form, he appears as an incredibly large lizard-like dragon, possessing a long slender body covered in motley brown scales, with 4 sets of legs that he uses to crawl along surfaces. His earthen magics reach a heightened peak in this form, and he is capable of causing tectonic shifts with his roars. His Ancestral Gem, the keystone of this transformation, is located as 4 gems, embedded in his forehead.
