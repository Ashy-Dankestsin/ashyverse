#### Personality and History
3rd daughter of the noble Branwen family and sole inheritor of her mother's Avesgloria blood, Morrigan had been taught from youth that her blood was all the family desired. To continue the lineage was her sole purpose, a purpose she would stop at nothing to run from. Despite her troubled childhood, in time she found solace in a friendship with a young Cath boy and his family, near the outskirts of her family's domain. Through a shared promise, Morrigan found the drive to escape her upbringing, eventually finding her place within the Judiciary, holding that oath warm in her heart all the way.

Loud, self-assured, and somewhat vain, Morrigan takes great pride in herself for having survived her past, and turning out "as hot as this despite it all", in her own words. Never to shy away from chit-chat, she zips between conversations as fast as a bird takes flight, soaking in and distributing juicy gossip at equal speeds. Owing to her close friendship with Roy, she carries much of the same flare of sarcasm as he does, but with a healthy dose of cheekiness to boot.

Despite having left her noble family and lifestyle behind, it is evident enough that its left some mark on her being, particularly her fixation on looks. A fashionista by heart, Morrigan enjoys nothing more than an indulgent shopping spree for all sorts of clothing and accessories, often times in the more risque department. Her pride in her looks is evident from the outset, as is her penchant for teasing, as she enjoys flaunting her looks for all (mostly girls) to see.

For all her self-aggrandizing and confidence, however, Morrigan possesses almost negative charisma in the field of romance. A romantic and a lesbian, she has gone to great lengths to woo women and find her one true love (a consort, if you will). However, for reasons simply far too complicated for her to comprehend, any and all attempts have fallen flat, leaving Morrigan none the wiser, and all the more despairing.

By Roy's approximations, it takes her around 2 days to recover from harsh rejections.

Though her life has been defined by a drive towards freedom, Morrigan has fully accepted at least one part of her predetermined fate, that being her destiny to become the One True King of Great Willowshire. By a promise made with her fellow fated King, Roy, Morrigan bound herself mentally to fulfilling that small wish. Stemming from perhaps a desire to change her nation, or a prayer to find acceptance within herself, she would stake her life on this oath. It was, ultimately, one she made with her dearest friend.

#### Skills
**Language of Magic: Wind**

Having studied the Language of Magic in the Sky Mother's Domain, Morrigan naturally trained in their curriculum, with a focus on wind-based arts. Due to her natural physique allowing for flight, she was able to learn advanced techniques that made use of her ability to take to the skies and strike foes from afar, a combination of wind compression and invisible wind blades. 
Morrigan herself is something of child prodigy, having picked up on the Language's principles shockingly quickly. However, she seems to ultimately favor her own base talent with the sword.

**Du Lac Swordsmanship - Combat Arts**

As a child, Morrigan was trained in basic swordsmanship by her eldest sister, as a form of self-defense. However, the brand of training she received was the nation's standard combat-focused style, turning Morrigan into a devilishly powerful swordswoman. Her physique allowing for dexterity and agility, combined with her own reflexes, makes her a fast and relentless fighter in battle. When combined with her Language of Magic, Morrigan is able to make short work of many foes.

**Flight**

As is expected of an Avesgloria, Morrigan was born with a pair of wings on her back, and a naturally lighter physique. Starting from around when she reached puberty, her wings had grown enough to allow for flight, a skill shes carried well into her current years. With a beat of her wings, Morrigan is able to soar upwards, as any bird would. However, her limited stamina keeps her from staying alight for too long.
