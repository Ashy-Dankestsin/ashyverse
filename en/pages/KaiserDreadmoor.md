#### Personality and History
The longtime head of House Dreadmoor, and leader of the dauntless Obsidian Clove faction. Kaiser Dreadmoor is an equal parts feared and respected individual, having been a Knight Lord for close to 40 years, and being a major figure in the politics of the lands. His House has been known throughout the lands as one of Willowshire's finest, no doubt due to Kaiser's personal contributions to the nation. However, his rigidness has often led to infighting amongst the Knight Lords, and his years of service has yet to be enough to fully wear down his hardened beliefs.

A stern and disciplined man, Kaiser commands the air of any room he sets foot in. Senior in both rank and age to basically every knight in service to Great Willowshire, his air of authority is second to none, taking to heart the absolute diligence he believes is required of any knight who would proclaim themselves as such. As upright as he is rigid, Kaiser can be seen as an immovable volcano, a man who stands tall in the face of adversary no matter the costs.

Kaiser, alongside his physical strength, is also well-read in the field of politics and government. Studious and stalwart, he is often seen as the de facto leader of the Knight Lords thanks to his brilliance in these fields, and he wastes little time in his endeavors to ensure the continued prosperity of his nation. To Kaiser, Great Willowshire is his pride, and the people its joy. His loyalties to the Throne are only matched with his distaste of dissention, and he is quick to bring down a hammer of justice on those who would do harm to the nation's creed.

Due to his age and seniority, he often takes a mentor role to younger knights under his command, and has guided many squires towards a path of fierce rigidity. He acts as the surrogate guardian to fellow Knight Lord Donna, serving as her tutor in the ways of being a respectable Knight Lord.

Knighthood, for Kaiser, is a concept steeped in loyalty. To him, there are no "rogue knights", for the very concept of a knight is one who serves a liege, and nothing more. Even after his 40 years of service, he continues to hold absolute faith in the 1000-Year Oath made by Founding Knight Lancelot, and dutifully obeys the ancient laws set by the Empty Throne. He is second-to-none when it comes to the belief that a One True King will eventually arrive, but his brutal rigidness has led to much dissatisfaction in recent times, especially as rhetoric against the Oath has been developing. Even so, Kaiser will continue to serve this absent king.

#### Skills
**Du Lac Swordsmanship: Mastery**
A master of swordfighting, Kaiser is well-trained in the standard Du Lac Swordsmanship of his nation, although his combat style differs from the usual knight in various ways. His weapon is neither a broadsword nor a rapier; rather, Kaiser practices this elegant and swift combat style with a hunk of pure obsidian, fashioned into a crude sword. The weapon holds sentimental value to him, having been a marriage gift from his husband, and he has certainly not let its unorthodox bulk weigh him down. Adapting the various speedy stances of Du Lac Swordsmanship into slower but heavier swings, Kaiser can easily shatter formations through sheer force alone, while still displaying the swordplay befitting a master of his ranking.

**Language of Magic: Magma**
The second way his fighting style differs from the Willowian standard. Instead of using torrential currents of pure water, Kaiser manipulates flowing arcs of molten lava throughout his fighting style. Through churns and molten ruptures, his proficiency in this form of magic can devastate battlefields with intense heat and blaze, a natural disaster manifested in a mountain of a man. Kaiser himself struggles with the heat, however, and thus limits the use of his magic in close-quarters combat, mostly using it as a warding or scare tactic, or to simply infuse his magma-proof blade with additional heat and power.
